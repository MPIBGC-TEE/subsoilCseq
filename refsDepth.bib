	abstract = {Abstract Aim This study aimed to infer the allocation of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) to sequential soil depths down to 2 m across the globe at a 1 km resolution and assess underlying environmental drivers. Location Global. Time Period Contemporary (1932--2017). Major Taxa Studied Terrestrial plants. Methods Global datasets including field net primary production (NPP, i.e., the difference between plant assimilated and respired carbon) from 725 soil profiles, root biomass and its depth distribution from 559 soil profiles were compiled and used to infer the depth distribution of BNPP across the globe and digitally map depth-resolved BNPP globally at 1 km resolution. Drivers of the depth distribution of BNPP were evaluated using machine learning-based models. Results Global average BNPP allocated to the 0--20 cm soil layer is estimated to be 1.1 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, accounting for ~60\% of total BNPP. Across the globe, the depth distribution of BNPP varies largely, and more BNPP is allocated to deeper layers in hotter and drier regions. Edaphic, climatic and topographic properties (in order of importance) explain >80\% of such variability; and the direction and magnitude of the influence of individual properties are soil depth- and biome-dependent. Main Conclusions The findings suggest that mean annual temperature and precipitation are the two most important factors regulating BNPP across the globe. Soil properties such as soil actual evaporation and total nitrogen also play a vital role in regulating the depth distribution of BNPP. The maps of BNPP provide global benchmarks of depth-resolved BNPP for the prediction of whole-profile soil carbon dynamics across biomes.},

	abstract = {Soils store more carbon than other terrestrial ecosystems1,2. How soil organic carbon (SOC) forms and persists remains uncertain1,3, which makes it challenging to understand how it will respond to climatic change3,4. It has been suggested that soil microorganisms play an important role in SOC formation, preservation and loss5--7. Although microorganisms affect the accumulation and loss of soil organic matter through many pathways4,6,8--11, microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an integrative metric that can capture the balance of these processes12,13. Although CUE has the potential to act as a predictor of variation in SOC storage, the role of CUE in SOC persistence remains unresolved7,14,15. Here we examine the relationship between CUE and the preservation of SOC, and interactions with climate, vegetation and edaphic properties, using a combination of global-scale datasets, a microbial-process explicit model, data assimilation, deep learning and meta-analysis. We find that CUE is at least four times as important as other evaluated factors, such as carbon input, decomposition or vertical transport, in determining SOC storage and its spatial variation across the globe. In addition, CUE shows a positive correlation with SOC content. Our findings point to microbial CUE as a major determinant of global SOC storage. Understanding the microbial processes underlying CUE and their environmental dependence may help the prediction of SOC feedback to a changing climate.},

@article{Taghizadeh2014,
	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a significant component of the global carbon (C) cycle. Changes in SOC storage affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations on decadal to centennial timescales. The C-TOOL model was developed to simulate farm- and regional-scale effects of management on medium- to long-term SOC storage in the profile of well-drained agricultural mineral soils. C-TOOL uses three SOC pools for both the topsoil (0--25cm) and the subsoil (25--100cm), and applies temperature-dependent first order kinetics to regulate C turnover. C-TOOL also enables the simulation of 14C turnover. The simple model structure facilitates calibration and requires few inputs (mean monthly air temperature, soil clay content, soil C/N ratio and C in organic inputs). The model was parameterised using data from 19 treatments drawn from seven long-term field experiments in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. It was found that the initial SOC content had to be optimised for each experiment, but also that one set of values for other model parameters could be applied at all sites. With this set of parameters, C-TOOL can be applied more widely to evaluate effects of management options on SOC storage in temperate agricultural soils. C-TOOL simulates observed losses of SOC in soils under intensive agricultural use and the gain in SOC derived from large inputs of animal manure and inclusion of perennial grassland. The model simulates changes in SOC for the entire profile, but lack of data on subsoil SOC storage hampers a proper model evaluation. Experimental verification of management effects on subsoil C storage, subsoil C inputs from roots, and vertical transport of C in the soil profile remains prioritised research areas.},

@article{Schiedung2019,
	abstract = {Abstract Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) has been recognized as an opportunity to off-set global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Flipping (full inversion to 1--3 m) is a practice used on New Zealand's South Island West Coast to eliminate water-logging in highly podzolized sandy soils. Flipping results in burial of SOC formed in surface soil horizons into the subsoil and the transfer of subsoil material low in SOC to the ``new'' topsoil. The aims of this study were to quantify changes in the storage and stability of SOC over a 20-year period following flipping of high-productive pasture grassland. Topsoils (0--30 cm) from sites representing a chronosequence of flipping (3--20 years old) were sampled (2005/07) and re-sampled (2017) to assess changes in topsoil carbon stocks. Deeper samples (30--150 cm) were also collected (2017) to evaluate the changes in stocks of SOC previously buried by flipping. Density fractionation was used to determine SOC stability in recent and buried topsoils. Total SOC stocks (0--150 cm) increased significantly by 69 $\pm$ 15\% (179 $\pm$ 40 Mg SOC ha-1) over 20 years following flipping. Topsoil burial caused a one-time sequestration of 160 $\pm$ 14 Mg SOC ha-1 (30--150 cm). The top 0--30 cm accumulated 3.6 Mg SOC ha-1 year-1. The chronosequence and re-sampling revealed SOC accumulation rates of 1.2--1.8 Mg SOC ha-1 year-1 in the new surface soil (0--15 cm) and a SOC deficit of 36 $\pm$ 5\% after 20 years. Flipped subsoils contained up to 32\% labile SOC (compared to <1\% in un-flipped subsoils) thus buried SOC was preserved. This study confirms that burial of SOC and the exposure of SOC depleted subsoil results in an overall increase of SOC stocks of the whole soil profile and long-term SOC preservation.},

@article{Wang2023JCP,
	abstract = {The increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) causes serious environmental problems, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is suggested as an efficient strategy to offset global CO2 emissions. Deep tillage (DT) can change soil properties and the input and loss of OC, and then influence SOC sequestration across the whole soil profile. However, the effect of DT on SOC sequestration relative to conventional tillage (CT) under different environmental factors and management practices is unclear in China. In this study, we evaluated the response of SOC stock to DT based on collected field data (447 observations) with a meta-analysis. DT significantly increased SOC stock by 7.36% over CT, with a greater increase for subsoiling (8.76%) than for deep ploughing (DP) (5.85%). Subsoiling enhanced SOC across the 0--40 cm soil layer and the greatest increase occurred at 0--10 cm layer (11.41%); DP enhanced SOC stock at 10--40 cm layer, but had no effect on SOC of 0--10 cm layer. DP and subsoiling did not affect SOC storage below 40 cm depth. According to subgroup analysis, the high rainfall, fine soil texture, residue retained, double cropping, and high rate of N fertilization greatly promoted SOC stock compared with the low rainfall, sandy texture, residue removal, monoculture, and low N fertilizer input under DT. DT significantly enhanced SOC storage under low initial SOC (<15 g kg−1), but did not affect SOC when the initial SOC exceeded 15 g kg−1 compared with CT. However, the experiment duration, initial SOC and bulk density (BD) did not significantly affect the response of SOC to DT. Overall, this study has supplied a reference for SOC management in mitigating climate change, and the specific environmental factors and management practice should be considered when utilizing DT to enhance SOC sequestration in different regions of China.},

@article{Alcantara2016,
	abstract = {Abstract Subsoils play an important role within the global C cycle, since they have high soil organic carbon (SOC) storage capacity due to generally low SOC concentrations. However, measures for enhancing SOC storage commonly focus on topsoils. This study assessed the long-term storage and stability of SOC in topsoils buried in arable subsoils by deep ploughing, a globally applied method for breaking up hard pans and improving soil structure to optimize crop growing conditions. One effect of deep ploughing is translocation of SOC formed near the surface into the subsoil, with concomitant mixing of SOC-poor subsoil material into the `new' topsoil. Deep-ploughed croplands represent unique long-term in situ incubations of SOC-rich material in subsoils. In this study, we sampled five loamy and five sandy soils that were ploughed to 55--90 cm depth 35--50 years ago. Adjacent, similarly managed but conventionally ploughed subplots were sampled as reference. The deep-ploughed soils contained on average 42 $\pm$ 13\% more SOC than the reference subplots. On average, 45 years after deep ploughing, the `new' topsoil still contained 15\% less SOC than the reference topsoil, indicating long-term SOC accumulation potential in the topsoil. In vitro incubation experiments on the buried sandy soils revealed 63 $\pm$ 6\% lower potential SOC mineralisation rates and also 67 $\pm$ 2\% lower SOC mineralisation per unit SOC in the buried topsoils than in the reference topsoils. Wider C/N ratio in the buried sandy topsoils than in the reference topsoils indicates that deep ploughing preserved SOC. The SOC mineralisation per unit SOC in the buried loamy topsoils was not significantly different from that in the reference topsoils. However, 56 $\pm$ 4\% of the initial SOC was preserved in the buried topsoils. It can be concluded that deep ploughing contributes to SOC sequestration by enlarging the storage space for SOC-rich material.},

@article{Sanderman2017,
	abstract = {Human appropriation of land for agriculture has greatly altered the terrestrial carbon balance, creating a large but uncertain carbon debt in soils. Estimating the size and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss due to land use and land cover change has been difficult but is a critical step in understanding whether SOC sequestration can be an effective climate mitigation strategy. In this study, a machine learning-based model was fitted using a global compilation of SOC data and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) land use data in combination with climatic, landform and lithology covariates. Model results compared favorably with a global compilation of paired plot studies. Projection of this model onto a world without agriculture indicated a global carbon debt due to agriculture of 133 Pg C for the top 2 m of soil, with the rate of loss increasing dramatically in the past 200 years. The HYDE classes ``grazing'' and ``cropland'' contributed nearly equally to the loss of SOC. There were higher percent SOC losses on cropland but since more than twice as much land is grazed, slightly higher total losses were found from grazing land. Important spatial patterns of SOC loss were found: Hotspots of SOC loss coincided with some major cropping regions as well as semiarid grazing regions, while other major agricultural zones showed small losses and even net gains in SOC. This analysis has demonstrated that there are identifiable regions which can be targeted for SOC restoration efforts.},

@article{Cotrufo2022,
	abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) provides vital services to humanity. Its preservation and further accrual are key to sustain food production and avoid an irreversible climate crisis. Here we present the processes and drivers of SOM formation and persistence within a coherent state-of-the-art framework. We posit that SOM forms via two distinct pathways depending on whether inputs are water soluble and/or easily solubilized entering the soil as dissolved organic matter (DOM), or they are structural. These distinct inputs form mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), and particulate organic matter (POM), respectively. Both these SOM fractions have plant and microbial components but in different proportions, with MAOM being more highly microbial. SOM persistence will depend on microbial activity inhibition, the degree of its limitation and carbon use efficiency, and microbial access constraints, primarily due to association to minerals and occlusions in fine aggregates. Climate is the overarching control of SOM persistence, also by affecting ecosystem traits, when persistence is driven by microbial activity inhibition or limitation, largely responsible for POM storage. Soil geochemical traits are the overarching control of SOM persistence driven by microbial access constraints, particularly in the subsoil, specifically controlling MAOM storage. SOM affects soil properties (aggregation, porosity, and cation exchange capacity) which in turn determine the soil's capacity for functioning and ability to provide desired outcomes including erosion and flood prevention, plant productivity, and climate mitigation. The specific properties of SOM which influence its contributions to these functions are discussed, with implications for SOM conservation and regeneration to promote desired outcomes.},

	abstract = {Soil is the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic carbon and is central for climate change mitigation and carbon-climate feedbacks. Chemical and physical associations of soil carbon with minerals play a critical role in carbon storage, but the amount and global capacity for storage in this form remain unquantified. Here, we produce spatially-resolved global estimates of mineral-associated organic carbon stocks and carbon-storage capacity by analyzing 1144 globally-distributed soil profiles. We show that current stocks total 899 Pg C to a depth of 1 m in non-permafrost mineral soils. Although this constitutes 66{\%} and 70{\%} of soil carbon in surface and deeper layers, respectively, it is only 42{\%} and 21{\%} of the mineralogical capacity. Regions under agricultural management and deeper soil layers show the largest undersaturation of mineral-associated carbon. Critically, the degree of undersaturation indicates sequestration efficiency over years to decades. We show that, across 103 carbon-accrual measurements spanning management interventions globally, soils furthest from their mineralogical capacity are more effective at accruing carbon; sequestration rates average 3-times higher in soils at one tenth of their capacity compared to soils at one half of their capacity. Our findings provide insights into the world's soils, their capacity to store carbon, and priority regions and actions for soil carbon management.},

	abstract = {A continuously growing pressure to increase food, fiber, and fuel production to meet worldwide demand and achieve zero hunger has put severe pressure on soil resources. Abandoned, degraded, and marginal lands with significant agricultural constraints---many still used for agricultural production---result from inappropriately intensive management, insufficient attention to soil conservation, and climate change. Continued use for agricultural production will often require ever more external inputs such as fertilizers and herbicides, further exacerbating soil degradation and impeding nutrient recycling and retention. Growing evidence suggests that degraded lands have a large potential for restoration, perhaps most effectively via perennial cropping systems that can simultaneously provide additional ecosystem services. Here we synthesize the advantages of and potentials for using perennial vegetation to restore soil fertility on degraded croplands, by summarizing the principal mechanisms underpinning soil carbon stabilization and nitrogen and phosphorus availability and retention. We illustrate restoration potentials with example systems that deliver climate mitigation (cellulosic bioenergy), animal production (intensive rotational grazing), and biodiversity conservation (natural ecological succession). Perennialization has substantial promise for restoring fertility to degraded croplands, helping to meet future food security needs.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as active and mobile carbon, plays a critical role in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how the concentration and biodegradability of soil-derived DOC (extracted from pore water or soil leachates) vary over a global scale and what determines the variations in DOC concentration and biodegradability. Here we addressed this issue by synthesizing the dataset involved in 121 sites from 39 literatures worldwide, and analyzed the patterns and drivers of DOC concentration and biodegradability. Our results showed that the DOC concentration in either pore water or soil leachates varied considerably, with mean values of 33.2 mg L−1 in pore water and 213.5 mg kg−1 in soil leachates, respectively. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) was the dominant control on the variability in soil-derived DOC concentration. Our results also revealed that the biodegradability of DOC in pore water was significantly lower than that in soil leachates, with the means of 16.5% versus 28.7%, respectively. Specific UV absorbance (SUVA254, a parameter used for evaluating dissolved aromatic carbon content) was the primary indicator predicting the spatial variation in DOC biodegradability, whereas MAP exerted limited effects on DOC biodegradability. These results demonstrate the high biodegradability of soil-derived DOC, highlighting its crucial role in the global carbon cycle under climate change.},

@article{Mary2020,
	abstract = {In spite of the large number of studies conducted on the drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, there is still no consensus on the impact of tillage on the distribution and turnover rate of SOC in the soil profile. Few studies have characterized precisely the turnover of SOC using 13C natural tracing or simulated the SOC evolution per soil layer. In this study, we combined several approaches (diachronic analysis of SOC stocks, isotopic tracing and modelling) for characterizing the SOC evolution per soil layer in one of the oldest tillage experiments comparing no-till (NT), shallow till (ST) and full inversion tillage (FIT) combined with six crop managements. The new measurements made in 2017 reported in this paper confirm that i) tillage had no effect on SOC stocks integrated over the old ploughed layer (∼0−28 cm) or deeper (∼0−58 cm) and ii) reduced tillage affected the SOC distribution in the soil profile, with SOC storage in the upper layer (∼0−10 cm) offset by a SOC loss in the underlying layer (∼10−28 cm). The change in rotation (from C4 to C3 crops) in two crop management treatments allowed to quantify the decrease in C4 stocks during 19 years and calculate the specific mineralization rates relative to tillage treatments and soil layers. The mineralization rates did not vary significantly between tillage treatments in the whole (old) ploughed layer (∼0−28 cm) but varied according to depth and tillage. The highest rates were found in the layer 0−5 cm of NT or ST and the lowest rates in the layer 10−28 cm of the same tillage treatments. The rates were highly correlated with estimated C inputs and particulate organic matter contents in each layer, but not with tillage intensity. The evolution of total SOC and C4 stocks of each soil layer was simulated with AMG model during 47 years. The standard model (with a single mineralization rate) gave a good prediction of SOC evolution when applied to the whole profile (∼0−28 cm) but not for each individual layer. Including a relationship between C input and mineralization rate in the model allowed to well simulate the SOC evolution in all soil layers. This study shows that the main effect of a change in tillage on SOC storage is the change in the distribution of C input throughout the profile and the corresponding variation of the priming effect rather than the change in physical soil disturbance.},

@article{Luo2010,
	abstract = {Adopting no-tillage in agro-ecosystems has been widely recommended as a means of enhancing carbon (C) sequestration in soils. However, study results are inconsistent and varying from significant increase to significant decrease. It is unclear whether this variability is caused by environmental, or management factors or by sampling errors and analysis methodology. Using meta-analysis, we assessed the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to conversion of management practice from conventional tillage (CT) to no-tillage (NT) based on global data from 69 paired-experiments, where soil sampling extended deeper than 40cm. We found that cultivation of natural soils for more than 5 years, on average, resulted in soil C loss of more than 20tha−1, with no significant difference between CT and NT. Conversion from CT to NT changed distribution of C in the soil profile significantly, but did not increase the total SOC except in double cropping systems. After adopting NT, soil C increased by 3.15$\pm$2.42tha−1 (mean$\pm$95% confidence interval) in the surface 10cm of soil, but declined by 3.30$\pm$1.61tha−1 in the 20--40cm soil layer. Overall, adopting NT did not enhance soil total C stock down to 40cm. Increased number of crop species in rotation resulted in less C accumulation in the surface soil and greater C loss in deeper layer. Increased crop frequency seemed to have the opposite effect and significantly increased soil C by 11% in the 0--60cm soil. Neither mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall nor nitrogen fertilization and duration of adopting NT affected the response of soil C stock to the adoption of NT. Our results highlight that the role of adopting NT in sequestrating C is greatly regulated by cropping systems. Increasing cropping frequency might be a more efficient strategy to sequester C in agro-ecosystems. More information on the effects of increasing crop species and frequency on soil C input and decomposition processes is needed to further our understanding on the potential ability of C sequestration in agricultural soils.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (OC) sequestration (i.e. the capture and long-term storage of atmospheric CO2) is being considered as a possible solution to mitigate climate change, notably through land use change (conversion of cropped land into pasture) and conservation agricultural practices (reduced tillage). Subsoil horizons (from 30 cm to 1 m) contribute to ca. half the total amount of soil OC, and the slow dynamics of deep OC as well as the relationships between the OC depth distribution and changes in land use and tillage practices still need to be modelled. We developed a fully modular, mechanistic OC depth distribution model, named OC-VGEN. This model includes OC dynamics, plant development, transfer of water, gas and heat, mixing by bioturbation and tillage as processes and climate and land use as boundary conditions. OC-VGEN allowed us to test the impact of 1) different numerical representations of root depth distribution, decomposition coefficients and bioturbation; 2) evolution of forcing factors such as land use, agricultural practices and climate on OC depth distribution at the century scale. We used the model to simulate decadal to century time scale experiments in Luvisols with different land uses (pasture and crop) and tillage practices (conventional and reduced) as well as projection scenarios of climate and land use at the horizon of 2100. We showed that, among the different tested formalisms/parametrizations: 1) the sensitivity of the simulated OC depth distribution to the tested numerical representations depended on the considered land use; 2) different numerical representations may accurately fit past soil OC evolution while leading to different OC stock predictions when tested for future forcing conditions (change of land use, tillage practice or climate).},

Simulated processes include water, solute and heat flow, C-cycle, bioturbation, physical weathering and clay migration. After a calibration of the calcite dissolution constant and parameters affecting clay migration, modeling results after 15,000 years were confronted with today's measurements at 3 positions in a toposequence in loess. The model was able to simulate the formation of A, E and Bt-horizons and decalcification of the loess, and responded to local differences in exposition and slope in a way confirmed by measurements along the toposequence. Best values for dissimilarity were obtained for organic carbon, sand % and CEC. Results indicate that simulation quality is sensitive to adequate estimation of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and evaporation from leaf interception. Likewise, an accurate reconstruction of the initial condition of the parent material in terms of calcite content, bulk density and clay content is important to allow correct estimates of clay transport and decalcification.},

	abstract = {Permafrost thaw will release additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere resulting in a positive feedback to climate change. However, the mineralization dynamics of organic matter (OM) stored in permafrost-affected soils remain unclear. We used physical soil fractionation, radiocarbon measurements, incubation experiments, and a dynamic decomposition model to identify distinct vertical pattern in OM decomposability. The observed differences reflect the type of OM input to the subsoil, either by cryoturbation or otherwise, e.g. by advective water-borne transport of dissolved OM. In non-cryoturbated subsoil horizons, most OM is stabilized at mineral surfaces or by occlusion in aggregates. In contrast, pockets of OM-rich cryoturbated soil contain sufficient free particulate OM for microbial decomposition. After thaw, OM turnover is as fast as in the upper active layer. Since cryoturbated soils store ca. 450 Pg carbon, identifying differences in decomposability according to such translocation processes has large implications for the future global carbon cycle and climate, and directs further process model development.},

	abstract = {The natural processes that mix soil are commonly referred to as pedoturbation. Major processes include digging by animals, uprooting of trees, swelling of clay, and downslope movement under gravity. The effects can be immediately manifested or imperceptibly slow. They may promote or retard the differentiation of the soil profile into horizons, and modify soil porosity. Less obvious processes of pedoturbation include the movement of air and water, freezing and thawing, growth of salt crystals, and meteoric impacts. Human activities are also a form of pedoturbation, disturbing the soil, as in agriculture, mining, and construction. The well-mixed, uppermost part of most soils may be thought of as a biomantle, the lower boundary of which is sometimes marked by a stone line bearing archaeological secrets. The structure and porosity of the biomantle, critical to soil quality, is maintained to a large extent by faunal activity and partly substituted in agriculture by conventional tillage. According to this paradigm, soil management ought to become more cognizant than it has been of the refreshing, rejuvenating, and pedogenic effects of natural pedoturbation.},

An analysis of 21 pedons revealed that an average of 55\% of the SOC density of the active layer and near-surface permafrost could be attributed to redistribution from cryoturbation. Cryoturbation occurs most strongly under conditions of poor drainage, where the parent materials are enriched in silt, and where frost boils are present. Based on published radiocarbon dates of buried SOC, cryoturbation was particularly important during periods of the mid-Holocene when the arctic underwent warming. These results suggest that continued warming of the arctic could accelerate cryoturbation and enable the soil to store more SOC than at present, thereby mitigating some of the loss of CO2 to the atmosphere from increased soil respiration.},

	abstract = {Abstract It is well-known that soil carbon composition and turnover rate vary with soil depth, and the responses of soil carbon to global change in deeper soil layers may differ from those near the surface. Therefore, vertically resolved soil carbon models are needed for accurately predicting future soil carbon under global warming. In this study, we developed a vertically resolved soil carbon model by including vertical transport of soil carbon and using Michaelis-Menten kinetics for soil carbon decomposition by microbes. The model was calibrated against six sites with the observed profiles of both soil carbon concentration and 14C measurements, and against 91 forest sites with soil carbon concentrations across a wide range of climate and soil conditions for four forest types in Europe and China. Results of independent model validation at another 93 sites showed that the calibrated model explained 40\%--94\% of the observed variance of soil carbon concentrations at different depths. Model sensitivity analysis showed that microbial activity and root carbon inputs are more important than soil carbon diffusion in simulating soil carbon profile. Results from our study highlight the need for detailed measurements of soil microbial activities and root carbon input at different soil depths in the field.},

	abstract = {Although subsurface horizons store more than half the total soil organic carbon (SOC) globally, the sources and dynamics of subsurface SOC are still unknown. Root litter input and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transport are possible sources. Using a vertically extended soil C model, we explore the role of root C input and DOC transport in controlling subsurface SOC dynamics. The model involves organic matter decomposition and DOC leaching in the aboveground litter layer, the belowground input of C from roots, and SOC turnover and DOC transport along water flows throughout the soil profile for three SOC pools (active, slow, and passive --- characterized by a turnover time of years, decades, and millennia, respectively). Model simulations with a range of rooting profiles demonstrate that a large proportion (36\% -- 78\% --- greater in deeper rooting profiles) of SOC is apportioned to the subsurface horizons (below the top 30 cm). A significant part (39\% -- 73\%) of subsurface SOC was found to be associated with C pools that turn over on time scales of decades or less. DOC transport appeared to be dominant in distributing the added C to the deeper soil layers, making the SOC content profile deeper than that of the root litter (C) input. The results suggest that current soil C studies focusing on the surface alone, significantly underestimate the stock of decadally cycling C, especially for deeply rooted ecosystems. Studies ignoring subsurface C dynamics therefore underpredict the responses of soil C to changes in climate, land use, and vegetation.},

	abstract = { Over 70\% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored at a depth greater than 20 cm belowground. A portion of this deep SOC actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales and is sensitive to global change. However, deep SOC responses to global change likely differ from surface SOC responses because biotic controls on SOC cycling become weaker as mineral controls predominate with depth. Here, we synthesize the current information on deep SOC responses to the global change drivers of warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Most deep SOC responses can only be hypothesized because few global change studies measure deep soils, and even fewer global change experiments manipulate deep soils. We call on scientists to incorporate deep soils into their manipulations, measurements, and models so that the response of deep SOC can be accounted for in projections of nature-based climate solutions and terrestrial feedbacks to climate change.

	abstract = {Increases in carbon (C) inputs to soil can replenish soil organic C (SOC) through various mechanisms. However, recent studies have suggested that the increased C input can also stimulate the decomposition of old SOC via priming. Whether the loss of old SOC by priming can override C replenishment has not been rigorously examined. Here we show, through data--model synthesis, that the magnitude of replenishment is greater than that of priming, resulting in a net increase in SOC by a mean of 32{\%} of the added new C. The magnitude of the net increase in SOC is positively correlated with the nitrogen-to-C ratio of the added substrates. Additionally, model evaluation indicates that a two-pool interactive model is a parsimonious model to represent the SOC decomposition with priming and replenishment. Our findings suggest that increasing C input to soils likely promote SOC accumulation despite the enhanced decomposition of old C via priming.},

	abstract = {Abstract Forest soils exhibit huge potential in storing carbon, but may also release large amounts of it if they undergo major changes in land use and environmental conditions. Biogeochemical processes controlling accumulation and release of soil organic carbon (SOC) are not yet sufficiently understood. We investigate the dynamics of SOC depending on its chemical composition below a natural forest (Podocarpus falcatus dominated) and a plantation (Eucalyptus saligna) growing on Nitisols in southern Ethiopia. Soils at the study-site show a huge shift to less negative δ13C values at a depth of 20--30 cm, indicating a change from C4 savanna to C3 forest during the late Holocene. Total organic carbon (TOC), black carbon (BC), and sugars from microbial (rhamnose, fucose) and plant origin (xylose, arabinose) are subjected to compound-specific stable isotope analysis. Turnover characteristics are calculated using a numerical advection--diffusion--decomposition model. Our measurements show significant differences in carbon storage (P<0.05) for both sites (Podocarpus 23.5 $\pm$ 3.2 kg SOC m−3; Eucalyptus 18.6 $\pm$ 2.7 kg SOC m−3). These differences can be explained with an initial loss of 15--26\% of TOC about 50 years ago, induced by clearing the natural forest. After canopy closure, the carbon input below Eucalyptus is 15--34\% less than below natural forest. At present, mean residence times (MRTs) of the investigated compounds do not differ between both stands. Sugars show the shortest MRTs in the topsoil with 2--7 years (xylose) and 5--13 years (arabinose) and have been affected the most by clear-cutting. TOC and BC show MRTs of 13--25 years and 20--34 years, respectively. Old C4 carbon below 20 cm has merely been affected by the land use change. Contrary to expectation, our study does not indicate a pronounced recalcitrance of BC.},

	abstract = {We modify the soil component of the ORCHIDEE terrestrial carbon cycle model to include vertically-discretized soil carbon. With this model, we investigate the feedback of considering thermal insulation by soil carbon, which modifies the soil thermal regime by lowering the thermal conductivity and increasing the heat capacity of a carbon-rich soil, on the total carbon stocks the model builds up. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of diffusive vertical mixing of soil organic matter by cryoturbation on the total carbon stocks that the model builds up in mineral soils in equilibrium with a steady climate. We show that including these two effects together leads to up to 30\% higher soil carbon stocks in the top meter of permafrost soils, as well as large stocks of carbon below 1m in the upper permafrost soil layers. The vertical profile of partitioning of carbon between different lability pools is also affected, as the slower pools are more deeply mixed; also the time to reach equilibrium lengthens considerably. These effects are largest in the coldest regions such as Eastern Siberia. The inclusion of cryoturbative mixing and insulation by soil carbon leads to better agreement with estimates of high-latitude soil carbon stocks, where substantial amounts of carbon are found in permafrost regions, to depths of three meters; however we do not include peat, Yedoma, or alluvial deposition processes here, so the total carbon stocks are still lower than observed.},

	abstract = {We explore a generalized stochastic description for the dispersal of particles in soils and sediments. The model is based on the continuous-time random-walk (CTRW), which enables a very general description of particle mixing due to biological activity. A community of burrowing organisms is characterized by a bioturbation ``fingerprint'' that consists of two probability distributions. The jump-length distribution describes the distance a particle travels within a given bioturbation event. The waiting-time distribution describes the time interval a particle waits at a given location in between two bioturbation events. Our stochastic analysis provides insight on the applicability of the widely used biodiffusion model, which forms the asymptotic limit of the CTRW model. This asymptotic behaviour of diffusion is always reached, independent of the shape of bioturbation fingerprint, provided that the waiting-time distribution has a finite mean and the jump-length distribution has a finite variance. The biodiffusion coefficient can be decomposed as the variance of the jump-length distribution over the mean of the waiting-time distribution. Since the variance enables a squared weighing of the jump distance, long-range displacements will contribute more to the mixing intensity Db than short-range displacements. Therefore, large macrofauna will contribute disproportionately to the mixing intensity relative to their abundance, as they displace particles over longer distances than smaller organisms. Finally, we review the potential for bioturbation of so-called anomalous transport models where either the mean of the waiting-time distribution or the variance of the jump-length distribution becomes infinite.},

	abstract = {A new model for biological activity and its effects in sediments is presented. Sediment is represented as a random 2D collection of solid and water ``particles'', distributed on a regular lattice with individually assigned chemical, biological and physical properties, e.g. food versus inert material. Model benthic organisms move through the lattice (the virtual sediment) as programmable entities, i.e., automatons, by displacing or ingesting--defecating particles. Each type of automaton obeys a different set of rules, both deterministic and stochastic, designed to mimic real infauna. In the present version of the model code, the organisms are simple small deposit feeders, resembling capitellids. The results from the model are 2D visualizations of the movement of the animals and the particles with time. The latter provide immediate appreciation of the consequences of animal actions on sediment fabric and composition, including both the mixing, traditionally associated with bioturbation, and the development of biologically-induced heterogeneities, which are observed in real sediments. The output is readily amenable to presentation as computer-generated (QuickTimeTM) movies, for which links are provided to such examples. As a particular case, we present a simulation of the mixing of a sand plug in a muddy sediment which shows that this is process not accomplished by counter-diffusion of sand and mud but by displacement and dilution of the sand with mud that is defecated as feces therein; this mode of mixing appears to be far more favorable to preservation of this sand feature than traditional diffusive models.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the practical aspects of differentiating between the solutions of the Diffusion and Telegraph Equations when they are used to model molecular diffusion in sediment porewaters and the diffusive bioturbation of solids. If molecular diffusion is the only transport mechanism in porewater, then the results from a simple random-walk model coupled to the hydrodynamic or kinetic theories of diffusion indicate that the solute profiles predicted by these two equations differ measurably only for periods up to 10−10 s after the introduction of a transient and for spatial scales less than 10−6 cm. In addition, the distinct propagating front predicted by the Telegraph Equation moves so fast and is so attenuated as to be unmeasurable. In this situation, the Telegraph Equation offers no practical advantage over the Diffusion Equation for the description of diagenetic porewater profiles. These findings also hold when advection due to burial and chemical reaction are included in the model. The time scales associated with bioturbation of solids are sufficiently long compared to normal sampling times that the profiles of some transients, both in deep-sea and near-shore sediments, should exhibit behavior characteristic of the Telegraph Equation if mixing is diffusive (local).},

@article{Meysman2005,
	abstract = {Current bioturbation models are marked by confusion in their treatment of porosity. Different equations appear to be needed for different biodiffusion mechanisms, i.e., interphase mixing, where biological activity causes bulk mixing of sediment affecting both tracer and porosity profiles, versus intraphase mixing, where the solid components are intermixed, but the porosity is left unchanged. Another issue is whether the model depends upon the particle type with which tracers are associated, e.g., 137Cs on small clay particles versus 210Pb on larger grains. This uncertainty has lead to conflicting conservation equations for radiotracers, and in particular, to the question whether the porosity should be placed inside or outside of the differential term that governs the biodiffusive flux. We have reexamined this situation in the context of multiphase, multicomponent continuum theory. Most importantly, we prove that under the assumption of steady-state porosity, there exists only one correct form of the steady-state conservation equation for a radiotracer, regardless of biodiffusion mechanism and particle type, i.e., ∂∂x[φsDB∂Cs∂x]−Fsedsρs∂Cs∂x−ϕsλCs=0 where x is depth, Cs is the concentration/activity of the tracer, Fseds is the constant flux of solid sediment to the sediment, ρs is the density of the solid phase, φs is the solid volume fraction, DB is the biodiffusion coefficient, and λ is the decay constant. This pertinent finding results from a substantial revision and extension of diagenetic theory. By considering the conservation of momentum, as well as mass, we have identified the correct reference velocities to define biodiffusional fluxes. From that, we have formulated a consistent set of model equations that govern (1) transient porosity and transient tracer concentrations, (2) steady-state porosity and transient tracer concentrations, and (3) steady-state porosity and steady-state tracer concentrations, in sediments that are subject to both compaction and bioturbation.},

	abstract = {Summary Models of soil genesis are potentially of great importance in assessing the effects of global change on ecosystems, and may also contribute to our understanding of soil genetic processes. Many quantitative models have so far focused on individual soil genetic processes and are difficult to extrapolate to the landscape scale. A few attempts have been made to model soil evolution as a whole from a pedologic perspective. This study develops a quantitative model of soil formation at the profile scale, taking into account major soil-forming processes. These include physical and chemical weathering of primary minerals, strain processes, and bioturbation. The model allows the quantification of the evolution of the particle size, mineral composition and bulk density of the soil. The model is applied with varying values of input parameters, and is compared with actual soil genetic processes. Running the model results in the formation of stone-layered soil profiles. Stone-line formation by means of bioturbation, as already described in the literature, seems to be adequately simulated. Planned improvements of the model include implementation of other major soil genetic processes such as leaching, organic matter influence, etc. This model will then have to be implemented spatially considering particularly redistribution processes, to reproduce soil formation at the landscape scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract The interaction of slope profile models with soil profile models is discussed in general terms to show the external constraints on each individual soil profile which set it within its catena context. The soil profile models discussed are primarily chemical, and treat the soil hydrology as externally imposed. Soil inorganic minerals are treated as mixtures of elementary oxides, using modified values for Gibb's free energies which are approximately valid for silicates. Soil organic matter is considered to consist of carbohydrates, amino acids and lignins, in order to simulate soil organic matter distributions with and without vertical mixing. The soil CO2 distribution is simulated via gaseous diffusion of the CO2 produced by organic matter decomposition. Soil pH is calculated with reference to the CO2 distribution, and allows the solubility equations to be solved through the resulting inorganic soil profile. A worked example is given for a soil profile in equilibrium with given external rates of mechanical and chemical denudation.},

@article{Bunzl2002,
	abstract = {It is well known that bioturbation can contribute significantly to the vertical transport of fallout radionuclides in grassland soils. To examine this effect also for a forest soil, activity--depth profiles of Chernobyl-derived 134Cs from a limed plot (soil, hapludalf under spruce) with a high abundance of earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus) in the Olu horizon (thickness=3.5 cm) were evaluated and compared with the corresponding depth profiles from an adjacent control plot. For this purpose, a random-walk based transport model was developed, which considers (i) the presence of an initial activity--depth distribution, (ii) the deposition history of radiocesium at the soil surface, (iii) individual diffusion/dispersion coefficients and convection rates for the different soil horizons, and (iv) mixing by bioturbation within one soil horizon. With this model, the observed 134Cs--depth distribution at the control site (no bioturbation) and at the limed site could be simulated quite satisfactorily. It is shown that the observed, substantial long-term enrichment of 134Cs in the bioturbation horizon can be modeled by an exceptionally effective diffusion process, combined with a partial reflection of the randomly moving particles at the two borders of the bioturbation zone. The present model predicts significantly longer residence times of radiocesium in the organic soil layer of the forest soil than obtained from a first-order compartment model, which does not consider bioturbation explicitly.},

@article{Muller1996,
	abstract = {In the context of safety analyses performed for radioactive waste repositories, one important group of scenarios assumes that radionuclides escaping from a repository will reach the biosphere via groundwater. Consequently, when calculating radionuclide migration in the biosphere, most of the models used to date concentrate on transport in the liquid phase. In the soil, however, transport in the solid phase can also be important, particularly when burrowing animals displace the soil together with sorbed and low-solubility radionuclides. Given the conditions prevailing in agricultural areas of central Europe, it is mainly earthworms which play a significant role in material displacement and these will be the subject of this report. According to the current data, it will take around 5--20 years for the earthworms to turn over the top soil of grasslands once, a process which results in intensive and more or less homogeneous mixing of the soil. Earthworms transport around 2 kg m−2 year −1 of dry matter from deep soil to top soil. A numerical example is used to present the equations which, for given distribution coefficients, can be applied to calculate the portions of the transfer coefficient which can be attributed to transport in the liquid and solid phases. The results demonstrate that material transport by soil fauna, and particularly by earthworms, is a relevant mechanism in many cases, especially for the upward transport of strongly sorbing radionuclides. It should therefore be considered in biosphere models.},

@article{Brovelli2012,
	abstract = {The quality of riparian soils and their ability to buffer contaminant releases to aquifers and streams are connected intimately to moisture content and nutrient dynamics, in particular of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). A multi-compartment model---named the Riparian Soil Model (RSM)---was developed to help investigate the influence and importance of environmental parameters, climatic factors and management practices on soil ecosystem functioning in riparian areas. The model improves existing tools, in particular regarding its capability to simulate a wide range of temporal scales, from days to centuries, along with its ability to predict the concentration and vertical distribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM). It was found that DOM concentration controls the amount of soil organic matter (SOM) stored in the soil as well as the respiration rate. The moisture content was computed using a detailed water budget approach, assuming that within each time step all the water above field capacity drains to the layer underneath, until it becomes fully saturated. A mass balance approach was also used for nutrient transport, whereas the biogeochemical reaction network was developed as an extension of an existing C and N turnover model. Temperature changes across the soil profile were simulated analytically, assuming periodic temperature changes in the topsoil. To verify the consistency of model predictions and to illustrate its capabilities, a synthetic but realistic soil profile in a deciduous forest was simulated. Model parameters were taken from the literature, and model predictions were consistent with experimental observations for a similar scenario. Modelling results stressed the importance of environmental conditions on SOM cycling in soils. The mineral and organic C and N stocks fluctuate at different time scales in response to oscillations in climatic conditions and vegetation inputs/uptake.},

	abstract = {Because dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role is terrestrial C-, N- and P-balances and transport of these three components to aquatic environments, there is a need to include it in models. This paper presents the concept of the newly developed DOM modules implemented in the DAISY model with focus on the quantification of DOM sorption/desorption and microbial-driven DOM turnover. The kinetics of DOM sorption/desorption is described by the deviation of the actual DOM concentration in solution from the equilibrium concentration, Ceq. The Ceq is soil specific and estimated from pedotransfer functions taking into account the soil content of organic matter, Al and Fe oxides. The turnover of several organic matter pools including one DOM pool are described by first-order kinetics. The DOM module was tested at field scale for three soil treatments applied after cultivating grass--clover swards. Suction cups were installed at depths 30, 60 and 90cm and soil solution was sampled for quantification of dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved organic N (DON). In the topsoil, the observed fluctuations in DOC were successfully simulated when the sorption/desorption rate coefficient k was low. In the subsoil, the observed concentrations of DOC were steadier and the best simulations were obtained using a high k. The model shows that DOC and DON concentrations are levelled out in the subsoils due to soil buffering. The steady concentration levels were based on the Ceq for each horizon and the kinetic concept for sorption/desorption of DOC appeared a viable approach. If Ceq was successfully estimated by the pedotransfer function it was possible to simulate the DOC concentration in the subsoil. In spite of difficulties in describing the DOC dynamics of the topsoil, the DOM module simulates the subsoil concentration level of DOC well, and also---but with more uncertainty---the DON concentration level.},

	abstract = {DyDOC describes soil carbon dynamics, with a focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The model treats the soil as a three-horizon profile, and simulates metabolic carbon transformations, sorption reactions and water transport. Humic substances are partitioned into three fractions, one of which is immobile, while the other two (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) can pass into solution as DOC. DyDOC requires site-specific soil characteristics, and is driven by inputs of litter and water, and air and soil temperatures. The model operates on hourly and daily time steps, and can simulate carbon cycling over both long (hundreds-to-thousands of years) and short (daily) time scales. An important feature of DyDOC is the tracking of 14C, from its entry in litter to its loss as DO14C in drainage water, enabling information about C dynamics to be obtained from both long-term radioactive decay, and the characteristic 14C pulse caused by thermonuclear weapon testing during the 1960s ("bomb carbon"). Parameterisation is performed by assuming a current steady state. Values of a range of variables, including C pools, annual DOC fluxes, and 14C signals, are combined into objective functions for least-squares minimisation. DyDOC has been applied successfully to spruce forest sites at Birkenes (Norway) and Waldstein (Germany), and most of the parameters have similar values at the two sites. The results indicate that the supply of DOC from the surface soil horizon to percolating water depends upon the continual metabolic production of easily leached humic material. In contrast, concentrations and fluxes of DOC in the deeper soil horizons are controlled by sorption processes, involving comparatively large pools of leachable organic matter. Times to reach steady state are calculated to be several hundred years in the organic layer, and hundreds-to-thousands of years in the deeper mineral layers. It is estimated that DOC supplies 89{\%} of the mineral soil carbon at Birkenes, and 73{\%} at Waldstein. The model, parameterised with "steady state" data, simulates short-term variations in DOC concentrations and fluxes, and in DO14C, which are in approximate agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a rain-event driven, process-oriented simulation model, DNDC, for the evolution of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and dinitrogen (N2) from agricultural soils. The model consists of three submodels: thermal-hydraulic, decomposition, and denitrification. Basic climate data drive the model to produce dynamic soil temperature and moisture profiles and shifts of aerobic-anaerobic conditions. Additional input data include soil texture and biochemical properties as well as agricultural practices. Between rainfall events the decomposition of organic matter and other oxidation reactions (including nitrification) dominate, and the levels of total organic carbon, soluble carbon, and nitrate change continuously. During rainfall events, denitrification dominates and produces N2O and N2. Daily emissions of N2O and N2 are computed during each rainfall event and cumulative emissions of the gases are determined by including nitrification N2O emissions as well. Sensitivity analyses reveal that rainfall patterns strongly influence N2O emissions from soils but that soluble carbon and nitrate can be limiting factors for N2O evolution during denitrification. During a year sensitivity simulation, variations in temperature, precipitation, organic C, clay content, and pH had significant effects on denitrification rates and N2O emissions. The responses of DNDC to changes of external parameters are consistent with field and experimental results reported in the literature.},

A mathematical model was constructed from kinetic equations for microbial activity reported in the literature and in earlier models, and was tested against C and N mineralization during incubation of labelled glucose, cellulose and crop residue on several soils. The model was able to reproduce temporal trends in the mineralization, immobilization and retention of labelled C and N to within 10% of recorded values over time scales of hours, days and years following soil amendments. By treating the humification and adsorption of microbial products as functions of soil clay content, the simulated mineralization of C amendments was reduced, and retention increased, to extents consistent with recorded data in soils with clay contents which varied from 4 to 34%. By allowing the decomposition of all soil organic matter to be determined by the total concentration of microbial biomass, the model also reproduced most of the increased mineralization of non-labelled C recorded from 14C-amended soils.},

	abstract = { The decomposition rates of 14C-labelled plant residues in different parts of the world were characterized and mathematically simulated. The easily decomposable materials, cellulose and hemicellulose, were described as being decomposed directly by the soil biomass; the lignin fraction of aboveground residues and the resistant portion of the roots entered a decomposable native soil organic matter. Here it could be decomposed by the soil biomass or react with other soil constituents in the formation of more recalcitrant soil organic matter. The transformation rates were considered to be independent of biomass size (first--order). Data from 14C plant residue incorporation studies which yielded net decomposition rates of added materials and from carbon dating of the recalcitrant soil organic matter were transformed to gross decomposition rate constants for three soil depths. The model adequately described soil organic matter transformations under native grassland and the effect of cultivation on organic matter levels. Correction for microbial growth and moisture and temperature variations showed that the rate of wheat straw decomposition, based on a full year in the field in southern Saskatchewan, was 0.05 that under optimal laboratory conditions. The relative decay rates for plant residues during the summer months of the North American Great Plains was 0.1 times that of the laboratory. Comparison with data from other parts of the world showed an annual relative rate of 0.12 for straw decomposition in England, whereas gross decomposition rates in Nigeria were 0.5 those of laboratory rates. Both the decomposable and recalcitrant organic matter were found to be affected by the extent of physical protection within the soil. The extent of protection was simulated and compared to data from experimental studies on the persistence of 14C-labelled amino acids in soil. The extent of protection influenced the steady-state levels of soil carbon upon cultivation more than did the original decomposition rates of the plant residues. },

@article{Rosenbloom2001,
	abstract = {Geomorphic erosion on hillslopes creates a distribution of soil properties within the landscape that influences ecosystem, erosional, and hydrological processes. These soil properties typically reflect topography and define a template for plant productivity and consequent soil carbon accumulation. Erosion also redistributes soil carbon and, by burying or excavating carbon, changes turnover time and may figure prominently in the global carbon budget [Stallard, 1998]. In this paper, we present the Changing Relief and Evolving Ecosystems Project (CREEP), a theoretical, process-response model that focuses on the redistribution of soil texture and soil carbon along a hillslope in response to geomorphic transport processes. The CREEP model simulates long-term ecological and geomorphic landscape evolution by simulating general soil, vegetation, and hillslope transport relationships. In particular, the model allows for the removal and downslope transport of soil carbon, as well as for the burial and decomposition of carbon in the accumulation zone. CREEP model results suggest that sandy soils are more likely to differentiate downslope with respect to soil texture than are more clay-rich soils and that this redistribution will lead to disproportionately broad areas of predominantly coarse-grained particles on upper slopes. Gridded biogeochemical models, which may otherwise overlook landscape heterogeneity, may use CREEP estimates of the areal distribution of soil texture as a basis for parametrically capturing trace gas fluxes nonlinearly related to soil texture.},

	abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) stabilisation in subsoil horizons received much attention in recent years, due to the presence of compounds with very long residence times. The reasons for enhanced organic carbon stabilisation in subsoil horizons are poorly understood. In this study, we characterised SOM in adjacent soil compartments with different pedological functioning. We sampled SOM in visually identifiable zones in form of tongues and the adjacent soil matrix from deep soil horizons (60--140cm depth) of 3 profiles under agricultural land. The samples were analysed for elemental and isotopic composition, radiocarbon age, chemical composition and lignin signature. The objective of the study was to examine if the tongues are characterised by contrasting carbon amounts and composition with regards to the soil matrix. Our results indicate that tongues have two times higher carbon content and are depleted in 15N with regards to the adjacent soil matrix. SOM in the tongues is characterised by up to modern radiocarbon ages, whereas SOM in the adjacent soil matrix is several thousand years old. Twenty percent more HF soluble carbon in the soil matrix suggest that more mineral bound, highly mobile SOM is present compared to tongues. Differences in chemical composition concern the lignin component, which seems to be preserved in the soil matrix. These data may be explained by different functioning in the two parts of the soil profile. In tongues, fresh carbon input by preferential flow and/or roots may lead to higher SOM turnover compared to the soil matrix. This heterogeneous distribution of stabilised SOM must be taken into account, when studying carbon sequestration in deep soil horizons.},

	abstract = {Soil organic matter (OM) stabilization by the mineral phase can take place through sorption and aggregation. In this study we examined both of these processes, (i) organic carbon (OC) sorption onto clay-sized particles and (ii) OC occlusion in silt-size aggregates, with the objective of evaluating their relative importance in OM storage and stabilization in soil. We studied two loamy soil profiles (Haplic Luvisol and Plinthic Cambisol) currently under agricultural use down to a depth of 2 m. Our approach was based on two parallel fractionation methods using different dispersion intensities; these methods isolated a free clay fraction (non-occluded) and a clay fraction occluded within water-stable silt-size aggregates. The two clay fractions were analysed for their C content and 14C activity. The proportion of sorbed OC was estimated as OC loss after hydrofluoric acid (HF) demineralization. Our results showed an important contribution to SOM stabilization by occlusion of OC into silt-size aggregates with depth through both soil profiles. In the Haplic Luvisol, OC associated with clay and located in silt-size aggregates accounted for 34--64\% of the total soil OC, whereas in the Plinthic Cambisol this occluded material represented 34--40\% of total OC. In the Haplic Luvisol, more OC was located in silt-size aggregates than was sorbed onto clay-size minerals, suggesting that silt-size aggregation plays a dominant role in OC storage in this soil. In the Plinthic Cambisol, the abundance of sorbed OC increased with depth and contributed more to the stored C than that associated with silt-size aggregates. Radiocarbon dating of both clay fractions (either occluded within silt-size aggregates or not) suggests, in the case of the Plinthic Cambisol, a preferential stabilization of OC within silt-size aggregates.},

	abstract = {Soil organic matter is known to contain a stable fraction with an old radiocarbon age. Size and stabilisation processes leading to the formation of this old soil carbon pool are still unclear. Our study aims to differentiate old organic matter from young and labile carbon compounds in two acid forest soils (dystric cambisol, haplic podzol). To identify such fractions soil samples were exposed to oxidation with Na2S2O8 and to dissolution by hydrofluoric acid (HF). A negative correlation between 14C activity and carbon release after dissolution of the mineral matrix by HF indicates a strong association of stabilised carbon compounds with the mineral phase. A negative correlation between the 14C activity and the relative proportion of carbon resistant to oxidation by Na2S2O8 shows that young carbon is removed preferentially by this treatment. The fraction remaining after oxidation represents a certain stabilised, long residence time carbon pool. This old fraction comprises between 1 and 30% of the total soil organic carbon in the surface horizons, but reaches up to 80% in the sub-surface horizons. Old OC is mainly stabilised by organo-mineral associations with clay minerals and/or iron oxides, whereas intercalation in clay minerals was not found to be important.},

	abstract = {Most decomposition studies have focussed on litter decomposition (Aerts 1997), and few studies concern decomposition of organic matter in humus layer and mineral soil. This is especially true for deeper soil horizons. In materials with a low decomposition rate, determination of CO2 evolution rate is a more sensitive way of estimating decomposition during a limited period of time than determining weight loss in litterbags. The efflux of CO2 from soil (soil respiration) originates not only from decomposer organisms assimilating organic matter but also from root and mycorrhizal respiration. To estimate the heterotrophic soil respiration, roots and mycorrhizal respiration must be excluded, for example, by removing roots and mycorrhiza through sieving. Although sieving disturbs the soil structure, we considered sieving as the best practical method for comparison of heterotrophic soil respiration [here called carbon (C) mineralisation] in different soil layers and at different sites. The sites are presented in Persson et al. (Chap. 2, this Vol.), and detailed site characteristics are given in Tables 2.1 and 2.3.},

@article{Rumpel2002,
	abstract = {Recent carbon inventories have shown that significant amounts of soil organic matter (SOM), even though at low concentrations, can be stored in the subsoil (B and C horizons). Its quantity, turnover and chemical composition are largely unknown. The objective of the present study was to analyse the organic matter in the mineral horizons of two forest soils with different pedogenetic history and to assess the quantity, turnover and chemical composition of SOM stored in the subsoil compared to the topsoil (A horizon and litter layers). Samples were taken from a Dystric Cambisol under beech and a Haplic Podzol under spruce forest down to a depth of 140 and 80 cm, respectively. They were analysed for elemental composition, carbon storage and chemical structure of SOM by 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, radiocarbon age by accelerator mass spectrometry and plant derived phenols as well as hydroxyalkanoic acids by CuO oxidation. Special attention was drawn to the contribution of phenols and hydroxyalkanoic acids, because they are major contributors of root litter. Up to 75% of the organic carbon present in the mineral soil of the two profiles was found below the A horizon. Radiocarbon measurements showed that the organic carbon in the subsoil had an apparent age of several thousand years. The structural analyses indicated a similar chemical composition of the organic matter present in the litter layers of both soils. In the mineral soils, the chemical composition of the SOM differed according to the pedogenetic processes operating at the two sites. A high contribution of alkyl carbon was recorded in the B horizons of the Dystric Cambisol which may be partly explained by the contribution of hydroxyalkanoic acids which are preserved preferentially in this soil compared to phenols. In the Haplic Podzol, spectra of the B horizons indicate a higher contribution of O-alkyl and carboxylic carbon due to carbon leaching during podzolisation. In the C horizons of both soils, most of the organic carbon was mobilised after demineralisation by treatment with 10% hydrofluouric acid (HF) and may therefore be adsorbed to the soil minerals. Our data indicated that there is, apart from root litter, a strong influence of soil-forming processes on the composition of organic carbon in subsoils.},

	abstract = {Abstract We used δ15N and δ13C measurements to study formation and decay of soil organic matter in surface soils of two oak (Quercus spp.) forests in Wisconsin. There were two controls of soil isotopic compositions: new litter inputs and overall isotopic fractionation during decomposition. Litter inputs lowered soil δ15N and δ13C values while decomposition increased δ15N and δ13C values. Leaf and root litter inputs averaged −3.8 and −1.6‰ δ15N and −27.3 and −28.2‰ δ13C, respectively. Field experiments showed that low surface soil δ15N and δ13C values resulted when litter inputs were high. Laboratory experiments showed that overall isotopic fractionation during decomposition left residual soil N and C enriched in 15N and 13C, and could explain the high δ15N and δ13C values observed in deeper forest soils (+5.9‰ δ15N and −23.6‰ δ13C for 10 to 20 cm soils). Our results suggest two pools of naturally labeled N in forest soils: surface N with low δ15N values and subsoil N with high δ15N values. Natural abundance measurements of soil N may be useful for following the importance of these two N pools in forest N cycles. We found no evidence for selective preservation of 13C depleted litter components, such as lignin, during long-term decomposition in forest soils.},

	abstract = {Between 30 and 63% of the soil organic matter (SOM) is stored below 30 cm, making subsoil-SOM an important source and sink in the global carbon cycle. Nevertheless, detailed information on the composition of subsoil-SOM remains scarce. This study aims to evaluate the chemical composition of SOM in topsoil and subsoil horizons in broadleaved forests on acid loamy soils. Six sites were chosen in Northern Belgium under beech, oak and hybrid poplar, on Gleysols, Umbrisols, Cambisols and Albeluvisols on loamy Quaternary deposits. Analytical pyrolysis--gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyrolysis--GC/MS) was performed on the dialyzed alkaline extract, which represents between 41 and 90% of the total organic carbon for the selected sites. All extracts show a significant shift in chemical composition between the topsoil and the subsoil. While topsoil-SOM mainly differs according to input and nutrient status, subsoil-SOM shows high relative amounts of alkanes and alkenes or polysaccharides for coarse and fine textured soils respectively. Lignins, lignin-derived phenols or aromatics were not major contributors to subsoil-SOM, regardless of soil type. Furthermore, results show that very labile plant-derived molecules are present in the subsoil, i.e. long-chain aliphatics and (cellulose-derived) anhydrosugars. The organic matter signature of the subsoil samples was evaluated for typical indications of fresh material, decay, podzolisation and anaerobic processes, and indicates root input and stabilization of certain labile plant-derived compounds against microbial decay to be important in the subsoil.},

	abstract = {Summary * Minirhizotron techniques were used to examine root lifespan in Vitis labruscana (Concord grape) for roots born in four different years that varied in rainfall. * Experimental vines were given irrigation (irrigated or not) and canopy pruning treatments (minimal or balanced). Root survival was assessed from 1997 through 2000 and analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Model covariates included pruning, irrigation, vine yield, soil depth, root diameter, time of root birth, and numbers of neighboring roots. * Soil depth, root diameter and time of birth consistently influenced root lifespan in all years (P < 0.05). Deeper and coarser roots had longer lifespans. Roots born near bloom were shorter-lived than roots born later in the season. Pruning and irrigation influenced root lifespan in some years but their effects seemed to vary with growing-season environmental conditions. * These data underscore the value of long-term studies in distinguishing factors that consistently affect root lifespan from those that change annually with environmental conditions, and emphasize the diversity in life histories of fine roots within a species.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin of the carbon (C) stabilised in soils is crucial in order to device management practices that will foster Caccumulation in soils. The relative contributions to soilC pools of roots vs. shoots is one aspect that has been mostly overlooked, although it appears a key factor that drives the fate of plant tissueC either as mineralized CO2 or as stabilized soil organic matter (SOM). Available studies on the subject consistently indicate that rootC has a longer residence time in soil than shootC. From the few studies with complete datasets, we estimated that the mean residence time in soils of root-derived C is 2.4times that of shoot-derived C. Our analyses indicate that this value is biased neither by an underestimation of root contributions, as exudation was considered in the analysis, nor by a priming effect of shoot litter on SOM. Here, we discuss the main SOM stabilisation mechanisms with respect to their ability to specifically protect root-derived SOM. Comparing in situ and incubation experiments suggests that the higher chemical recalcitrance of root tissues as compared to that of shoots is responsible for only a small portion, i.e. about one fourth, of the difference in mean residence time in soils of root-derived vs. shoot-derivedC. This suggests that SOM protection mechanisms other than chemical recalcitrance are also enhanced by root activities: (1)physico-chemical protection, especially in deeper horizons, (2)micrometer-scale physical protection through myccorhiza and root-hair activities, and (3)chemical interactions with metal ions. The impact of environmental conditions within deeper soil layers on rootC stabilisation appear difficult to assess, but is likely, if anything, to further increase the ratio between the mean residence time of root vs. shootC in soils. Future advances are expected from isotopic studies conducted at the molecular level, which will help unravel the fate of individual shoot and root compounds, such as cutins and suberins, throughout soil profiles.},

	abstract = {During their life, plant roots release organic compounds in their surrounding environment. This process, named rhizodeposition, is of ecological importance because (1) it is a loss of reduced C for the plant, (2) it is an input flux for the organic C pool of the soil and (3) it fuels the soil microflora, which is involved in the great majority of the biological activity of soils such as the nutrient and pollutant cycling or the dynamics of soil borne pathogens, for example. The present review first examines the mechanisms by which major rhizodeposits are released into the soil: production of root cap cells, secretion of mucilage, passive and controlled diffusion of root exudates. In a second part, results from tracer studies (43 articles) are analysed and values of C flux from the plant root into the soil are summarized. In average, 17{\%} of the net C fixed by photosynthesis is lost by roots and recovered as rhizosphere respiration (12{\%}) and soil residues (5{\%}), which corresponds to 50{\%} of the C exported by shoots to belowground. Finally, the paper reviews major factors that modify the partitioning of photoassimilates to the soil: microorganisms, nitrogen, soil texture and atmospheric CO2 concentration.},

	abstract = {The movement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) through soils is an important process for the transport of carbon within ecosystems and the formation of soil organic matter. In some cases, DOC fluxes may also contribute to the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems; in most ecosystems, they are an important source of energy, carbon, and nutrient transfers from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Despite their importance for terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemistry, these fluxes are rarely represented in conceptual or numerical models of terrestrial biogeochemistry. In part, this is due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the suite of processes that control DOC dynamics in soils. In this article, we synthesize information on the geochemical and biological factors that control DOC fluxes through soils. We focus on conceptual issues and quantitative evaluations of key process rates to present a general numerical model of DOC dynamics. We then test the sensitivity of the model to variation in the controlling parameters to highlight both the significance of DOC fluxes to terrestrial carbon processes and the key uncertainties that require additional experiments and data. Simulation model results indicate the importance of representing both root carbon inputs and soluble carbon fluxes to predict the quantity and distribution of soil carbon in soil layers. For a test case in a temperate forest, DOC contributed 25{\%} of the total soil profile carbon, whereas roots provided the remainder. The analysis also shows that physical factors---most notably, sorption dynamics and hydrology---play the dominant role in regulating DOC losses from terrestrial ecosystems but that interactions between hydrology and microbial--DOC relationships are important in regulating the fluxes of DOC in the litter and surface soil horizons. The model also indicates that DOC fluxes to deeper soil layers can support a large fraction (up to 30{\%}) of microbial activity below 40 cm.},

	abstract = {In this study, we examined changes in isotopic (13C and 14C) and spectroscopic (UV and 13C NMR) properties of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in relation to soil organic matter (SOM) to elucidate the sources and sinks of DOC as water percolates through the soils of two contrasting upland coastal California ecosystems---a redwood forest and a coastal prairie. Despite differences in the distribution of C stocks and litter chemistry at these two sites, we found similar shifts in DOC chemistry with soil depth. DOC concentrations dropped rapidly with increasing depth, with an accompanying decrease in the C:N ratio, an increase in the δ13C value and an decrease in specific UV adsorption. In the grassland soil, Δ14C values declined from current atmospheric values (+70‰) in the surface horizon to −75‰at 100 cm. In the redwood soil, the Δ14C value of 111‰in O horizon leachates was indicative of OM with a residence time of 8--10 yrs, with a decrease in Δ14C values to −80‰at 100 cm. Solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectra were generally most similar to highly humified OM, with a general decrease in the relative abundance of aromatic compounds and an increase in the alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio with increasing depth. All of these trends are consistent with the shifts in SOM properties with increasing depth, which are interpreted to mean a shift from fresh plant material to older, highly altered OM. In this Mediterranean climate, we found distinct seasonal shifts in the quantity and composition of DOC found in soil solution during the winter rainy period that was also consistent with a shift from recent labile substrates to older, highly altered OM. These results fit in with a growing body of literature suggesting that the source of much of the DOC within mineral soils is the local soil OM, and the 14C data, in particular, indicate that DOC at depth is not simply the fraction of surficial leachates that have not been adsorbed or decomposed. Rather, exchange reactions with a portion of the more stabilized SOM pool exert the strongest control on both the concentration and composition of DOC found in these soils.},

	abstract = {Abstract Estimates of carbon leaching losses from different land use systems are few and their contribution to the net ecosystem carbon balance is uncertain. We investigated leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved methane (CH4), at forests, grasslands, and croplands across Europe. Biogenic contributions to DIC were estimated by means of its δ13C signature. Leaching of biogenic DIC was 8.3$\pm$4.9 g m−2 yr−1 for forests, 24.1$\pm$7.2 g m−2 yr−1 for grasslands, and 14.6$\pm$4.8 g m−2 yr−1 for croplands. DOC leaching equalled 3.5$\pm$1.3 g m−2 yr−1 for forests, 5.3$\pm$2.0 g m−2 yr−1 for grasslands, and 4.1$\pm$1.3 g m−2 yr−1 for croplands. The average flux of total biogenic carbon across land use systems was 19.4$\pm$4.0 g C m−2 yr−1. Production of DOC in topsoils was positively related to their C/N ratio and DOC retention in subsoils was inversely related to the ratio of organic carbon to iron plus aluminium (hydr)oxides. Partial pressures of CO2 in soil air and soil pH determined DIC concentrations and fluxes, but soil solutions were often supersaturated with DIC relative to soil air CO2. Leaching losses of biogenic carbon (DOC plus biogenic DIC) from grasslands equalled 5--98\% (median: 22\%) of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) plus carbon inputs with fertilization minus carbon removal with harvest. Carbon leaching increased the net losses from cropland soils by 24--105\% (median: 25\%). For the majority of forest sites, leaching hardly affected actual net ecosystem carbon balances because of the small solubility of CO2 in acidic forest soil solutions and large NEE. Leaching of CH4 proved to be insignificant compared with other fluxes of carbon. Overall, our results show that leaching losses are particularly important for the carbon balance of agricultural systems.},

@article{Kalbitz2008,
	abstract = {Abstract Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often considered the most labile portion of organic matter in soil and to be negligible with respect to the accumulation of soil C. In this short review, we present recent evidence that this view is invalid. The stability of DOM from forest floor horizons, peats, and topsoils against microbial degradation increases with advanced decomposition of the parent organic matter (OM). Aromatic compounds, deriving from lignin, likely are the most stable components of DOM while plant-derived carbohydrates seem easily degradable. Carbohydrates and N-rich compounds of microbial origin produced during the degradation of DOM can be relatively stable. Such components contribute much to DOM in the mineral subsoil. Sorption of DOM to soil minerals and (co-)precipitation with Al (and probably also with Fe), especially of the inherently stable aromatic moieties, result in distinct stabilization. In laboratory incubation experiments, the mean residence time of DOM from the Oa horizon of a Haplic Podzol increased from <30 y in solution to >90 y after sorption to a subsoil. We combined DOM fluxes and mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to minerals and a subsoil horizon, and (co-)precipitated with Al to estimate the potential contribution of DOM to total C in the mineral soil of a Haplic Podzol in Germany. The contribution of roots to DOM was not considered because of lack of data. The DOM-derived soil C ranges from 20 to 55 Mg ha--1 in the mineral soil, which represents 19\%--50\% of the total soil C. The variation of the estimate reflects the variation in mineralization rate constants obtained for sorbed and (co-)precipitated DOM. Nevertheless, the estimates indicate that DOM contributes significantly to the accumulation of stable OM in soil. A more precise estimation of DOM-derived C in soils requires mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to all relevant minerals or (co-)precipitated with Fe. Additionally, we need information on the contribution of sorption to distinct minerals as well as of (co-)precipitation with Al and Fe to DOM retention.},

The focus was onannual fluxes and concentrations in throughfall,forest floor leachates and soil solutions. In allcompartments considered, concentrations and fluxesdiffered widely between the sites. Highestconcentrations of DOC and DON were generally observedin forest floor leachates and in A horizons. Highestfluxes occurred in forest floor leachates. The fluxesof DOC and DON in forest floor leachates increasedwith increasing annual precipitation and were alsopositively related to DOC and DON fluxes withthroughfall. Variation in throughfall fluxes couldexplain 46{\%} and 65{\%} of the variation in DOC and DONfluxes from the forest floor, respectively. No generaldifference in DOC and DON concentrations and fluxes inforest floor leachates was found when comparingconiferous and hardwood sites.

Our objectives were to assess the influence of exotic earthworm invasion on (a) the amount and depth distribution of soil C and N, (b) soil δ13C and δ15N, and (c) soil solution chemistry and leaching of C and N in forests with different land-use histories. At a relatively undisturbed forest site (Arnot Forest), earthworms eliminated the thick forest floor, decreased soil C storage in the upper 12 cm by 28{\%}, and reduced soil C:N ratios from 19.2 to 15.3. At a previously cultivated forest site with little forest floor (Tompkins Farm), earthworms did not influence the storage of soil C or N or soil C:N ratios. Earthworms altered the stable isotopic signature of soil at Arnot Forest but not at Tompkins Farm; the alteration of stable isotopes indicated that earthworms significantly increased the loss of forest floor C but not N from the soil profile at Arnot Forest. Nitrate (NO3−) concentrations in tension and zero-tension lysimeters were much greater at Tompkins Farm than Arnot Forest, and earthworms increased NO3−leaching at Tompkins Farm. The results suggest that the effect of earthworm invasion on the distribution, retention, and solution chemistry of soil C and N in northern temperate forests may depend on the initial quantity and quality of soil organic matter at invaded sites.},

	abstract = {In natural ecosystems, bioturbation is an essential component of soil formation, whereas tillage drives soil mixing in agricultural soils. Yet soil mixing is commonly neglected in modeling soil organic carbon (SOC) as it responds to land use changes. Here, in order to determine mixing-driven carbon fluxes, we combine a mass balance model with measurements of 210Pb activities and SOC contents. Soil mixing rates by tillage decrease from 3.4 $\pm$ 2.3 cm yr−1 at the surface to 0.8 $\pm$ 0.2 cm yr−1 at a depth of ∼20 cm, causing the SOC stored in the upper 25 cm of the soil to be physically turned over via mixing annually. In contrast, the bioturbation-driven soil mixing velocity at the forest increases from 0.6 $\pm$ 0.1 cm yr−1 at the surface to 2.7 $\pm$ 0.5 cm yr−1 at a depth of ∼10 cm, which results in physically turning over SOC in the A horizon via mixing on years to decadal time scales. Therefore, SOC fractions with different susceptibilities to decomposition may have significantly different physical trajectories within the soils over their lifespans, and thus the assumption of C-cycling models that all SOC fractions experience identical environmental conditions is unlikely to be realistic. Carbon sinks, excesses of plant carbon inputs over decomposition carbon losses, are found within the top portion of the A horizons. These carbon excesses are transferred, via mixing, to the lower portion of the A horizon, where they are decomposed. By quantifying mixing-derived SOC fluxes, this study shows a previously unrecognized complexity in understanding SOC dynamics associated with land use changes.},

@article{Tonneijck2008,
	abstract = {Summary Soil faunal bioturbation (`bioturbation') is often cited as a major process influencing the vertical distribution of soil organic matter (SOM). The influence of bioturbation on vertical SOM transport is complex because it is the result of interaction between different groups of soil faunal species that redistribute SOM through the soil profile in distinct ways. We performed a semi-quantitative micromorphological analysis of soil faunal pedofeatures and related their occurrence to the vertical distribution of SOM and high-resolution radiocarbon dating in volcanic ash soils under montane forest and grassland (p{\'a}ramo) vegetation in the northern Ecuadorian Andes. The p{\'a}ramo soil data suggest that bioturbation was largely responsible for the vertical distribution of SOM, while illuviation and root input were of minor importance. Bioturbation was caused by endogeic species, which typically mix the soil only over short vertical distances. Short vertical distance mixing was apparently enhanced by the upward shifting of bioturbation as a result of soil thickening due to SOM accumulation. A change from p{\'a}ramo to forest vegetation was accompanied by a change from endogeic to epigeic species. As these latter species do not redistribute material vertically, this eventually resulted in the formation of thick ectorganic horizons in the forest.},

	abstract = {Free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments in aggrading temperate forests and plantations have been initiated to test whether temperate forest ecosystems act as sinks for anthropogenic emissions of CO2. These FACE experiments have demonstrated increases in net primary production and carbon (C) storage in forest vegetation due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, the fate of this extra biomass in the forest floor or mineral soil is less clear. After 6 years of FACE treatment in a short-rotation poplar plantation, we observed an additional sink of 32 g C m−2 y−1 in the forest floor. Mineral soil C content increased equally under ambient and increased CO2 treatment during the 6-year experiment. However, during the first half of the experiment the increase in soil C was suppressed under FACE due to a priming effect, that is, the additional labile C increased the mineralization of older SOM, whereas during the second half of the experiment the increase in soil C was larger under FACE. An additional sink of 54 g C m−2 y−1 in the top 10 cm of the mineral soil was created under FACE during the second half of the experiment. Although, this FACE effect was not significant due to a combination of soil spatial variability and the low number of replicates that are inherent to the present generation of forest stand FACE experiments. Physical fractionation by wet sieving revealed an increase in the C and nitrogen (N) content of macro-aggregates due to FACE. Further fractionation by density showed that FACE increased C and N contents of the light iPOM and mineral associated intra-macro-aggregate fractions. Isolation of micro-aggregates from macro-aggregates and subsequent fractionation by density revealed that FACE increased C and N contents of the light iPOM, C content of the fine iPOM and C and N contents of the mineral associated intra-micro-aggregate fractions. From this we infer that the amount of stabilized C and N increased under FACE treatment. We compared our data with published results of other forest FACE experiments and infer that the type of vegetation and soil base saturation, as a proxy for bioturbation, are important factors related to the size of the additional C sinks of the forest floor--soil system under FACE.},

	abstract = {This paper expands the dynamic denudation framework of landscape evolution by providing new process insights and details on how soil and its signature morphological feature, the biomantle, form and function in the environment. We examine soils and their biomantles from disparate parts of the world, from the tropics through midlatitudes and hyperarid through perhumid, a range that exhibits varying environments for, and of, life. We then explicate the process pathways that cause soils to thicken and thin, and to even disappear, then reform. We do this by examining thickness relationships, where soil thickness st and biomantle thickness bt are functions of upbuilding u and deepening d minus removal r processes, hence st/bt=f(u+d−r). Upbuilding has two subsets, u1, which includes all exogenous (allochthonous---outside) mineral and/or organic inputs to the soil system, and u2, which includes all endogenous (autochthonous---in situ) processes and productions, including weathering. Exogenous u1 inputs include eolian and slopewash inputs (sedimentations) of mineral and organic materials, mass wasting accumulations and the like. Endogenous u2 processes and productions include the sum of in situ bioturbations, biosynthetic productions, organic accumulations, biovoid productions, weathering and volume increases caused by their sum. Endogenous upbuildings, which dominantly occur in the biomantle, are basically biodynamic bd processes and productions, hence u2=bd. Therefore, if exogenous upbuildings u1 are minimal or zero, then biomantle thickness bt is expressed by bt=f(u2−r) or bt=f(bd−r). Drawing on these relationships, we employ a graphic-conceptual device called process vector analysis in a digital animation (see supplementary materials or cf. https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/jdomier/www/temp/biomantle.html) that illustrates the main pathways that form both Earth's soil and its unique epidermis, the biomantle. We then discuss the main elements of the animation using still frames that represent thickness turning points. We end by encouraging researchers, instructors and students to view Earth's landforms and soils as integrated dynamic entities that are constantly coevolving elements of a global subaerial--subaqueous continuum.},

Here we use depth profiles and advection-diffusion modeling of fallout nuclides to quantify differences in short-term (\\&lt;100 yr) physical soil mixing across contrasting landscapes. We constrain advection in soils using the distribution of cosmogenic 7Be and weapons-derived isotopes, and quantify mixing with a steady-state model of vertical 210Pb transport. On a forested landscape in the Bega Valley in southeastern Australia and on grasslands in Marin County, California, where bioturbation is documented as the dominant sediment transport mechanism, we calculate diffusion-like mixing coefficients of 1--2 cm2 yr−1. In montane forest soils of northern New England, we observe little field evidence of short-term mixing, and find that the traditional advection-diffusion model fails to describe 210Pb profiles. Because nuclide profiles here can be described with a simple model of litterfall, organic matter decay, and radioactive decay, we argue that diffusion-like processes are barely active on short time scales, and that the advection-diffusion model overestimates diffusion-like transport. While animal bioturbation and soil freezing cycles have little effect on the fate of elements in New England, physical soil mixing drives transport at Bega Valley and Marin County. We suggest that the absence of soil stirring that we quantify in New England forests may explain the slow physical erosion here (∼0.2 cm/k.y.) relative to the actively bioturbated soils of Bega Valley and Marin County (5--10 cm/k.y.).}},

	abstract = {Despite their low carbon (C) content, most subsoil horizons contribute to more than half of the total soil C stocks, and therefore need to be considered in the global C cycle. Until recently, the properties and dynamics of C in deep soils was largely ignored. The aim of this review is to synthesize literature concerning the sources, composition, mechanisms of stabilisation and destabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) stored in subsoil horizons. Organic C input into subsoils occurs in dissolved form (DOC) following preferential flow pathways, as aboveground or root litter and exudates along root channels and/or through bioturbation. The relative importance of these inputs for subsoil C distribution and dynamics still needs to be evaluated. Generally, C in deep soil horizons is characterized by high mean residence times of up to several thousand years. With few exceptions, the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio is decreasing with soil depth, while the stable C and N isotope ratios of SOM are increasing, indicating that organic matter (OM) in deep soil horizons is highly processed. Several studies suggest that SOM in subsoils is enriched in microbial-derived C compounds and depleted in energy-rich plant material compared to topsoil SOM. However, the chemical composition of SOM in subsoils is soil-type specific and greatly influenced by pedological processes. Interaction with the mineral phase, in particular amorphous iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides was reported to be the main stabilization mechanism in acid and near neutral soils. In addition, occlusion within soil aggregates has been identified to account for a great proportion of SOM preserved in subsoils. Laboratory studies have shown that the decomposition of subsoil C with high residence times could be stimulated by addition of labile C. Other mechanisms leading to destabilisation of SOM in subsoils include disruption of the physical structure and nutrient supply to soil microorganisms. One of the most important factors leading to protection of SOM in subsoils may be the spatial separation of SOM, microorganisms and extracellular enzyme activity possibly related to the heterogeneity of C input. As a result of the different processes, stabilized SOM in subsoils is horizontally stratified. In order to better understand deep SOM dynamics and to include them into soil C models, quantitative information about C fluxes resulting from C input, stabilization and destabilization processes at the field scale are necessary.},

	abstract = {Carbon (C) sequestered in subsoils generally contributes to more than half of the total stocks within a soil profile. In contrast to topsoil, organic matter (OM) stored in subsoil horizons is characterised by high mean residence times. While the mechanisms and controls of OM stabilisation in topsoils are fairly well understood, processes and dynamics of subsoil OM stabilisation appear to be controlled by other factors. We summarize the available data on C quantities, chemical composition as well as decomposition and stabilisation dynamics in subsoils and discuss the relevance of these processes for longterm carbon storage. Moreover, the importance of spatial dist ribution of SOM and its degraders is addressed. The objective of this chapter was to discuss the controls of carbon sequestration in subsoil horizons in order to explore the possibility to increase soil carbon stocks by carbonising subsoil horizons. Subsoil C is characterised by much higher solubility after destruction of the mineral phase compared to topsoil C suggesting that much of it consists of small molecules stabilised by interaction with the mineral phase. The chemical composition of OM stabilised by mineral interactions in subsoil -horizons is different from those of topsoils. Precursors of this C may be root-derived and microbially processed organic matter as well as organic matter transported in dissolved form or by bioturbation. The reports about the environmental controls of subsoil OM degradation are conflicting, most likely due to site-specificity. The lower dynamics of temperature and soil moisture in subsoils may thus enhance or reduce OM mineralization, while low nutrient availability is a more common limiting factor. Spatial distribution of OM may determine the likelihood of its stabilisation at long time scales, which may be most related to absence of energy-rich material needed for decomposition. Therefore a suitable strategy for increasing C stocks in deep horizons may be the addition of highly stable OM such as biochar or highly aliphatic material.},

@article{Ponce1986,
	abstract = {SUMMARY Most soil properties vary down a soil profile. In nearly every case a graph of the value of the property against depth (the `true' curve) is smooth. However, a soil sample is usually taken from the whole of a horizon so that its analysis is the mean value for the horizon, and a graph of analyses against horizon depth is a `stepped' profile. It is possible to produce a smooth profile by attributing each analysis to the mid-depth of its horizon and fitting a polynomial or spline curve through these values, but the former may produce erratic results, and both of them produce curves in which the true maxima and minima may be considerably damped. This paper explores the possibility of deriving a better reconstruction of the true profile from the same number of analyses by: (a) taking the samples for analysis from narrow layers at depths that appear to correspond to maxima, minima, or points of inflexion on the true curve, and fitting spline curves through their values; (b) fitting a modified `equal-area' spline curve to conventional whole-horizon samples. The latter is considerably superior and, in most cases, achieves a surprisingly close reconstruction of the true profile from which the samples were taken.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to test the ability of equal-area quadratic splines to predict soil depth functions based on bulk horizon data. In addition, the possibility of improving the prediction quality by the use of additional samples from the top and/or bottom of soil profiles along with horizon data is examined. The predictive performance of the splines is compared with that of exponential decay functions, and 1st and 2nd degree polynomials. In addition, the predictive quality of the conventional horizon data is examined. The measure of predictive performance used is the root mean square error values calculated from differences between the `true' depth function and the fitted depth function. The `true' depth functions were derived from the intensive sampling and laboratory analysis of soil profiles. Three soil profiles were sampled; a Red Podzolic Soil (Red Kurosol), Podzol (Aeric Podosol) and Krasnozem (Red Ferrosol). The soil attributes that were measured included; pH, electrical conductivity (EC), clay %, sand %, organic carbon %, gravimetric water content at −33 kPa and air dry. The results clearly indicated the superiority of equal-area quadratric splines in predicting depth functions. Such splines depend on a parameter, λ that controls goodness-of-fit vs. roughness. Their quality of fit varied with the λ value used and it was found that a λ value of 0.1 was the best overall predictor of the depth functions. The results also showed that using additional samples from the top and/or bottom of the soil profiles improved the prediction quality of the spline functions.},

@article{Luo2020,
	abstract = {Abstract The fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) under warming is poorly understood, particularly across large extents and in the whole-soil profile. Using a data-model integration approach applied across the globe, we find that downward movement of SOC along the soil profile reduces SOC loss under warming. We predict that global SOC stocks (down to 2 m) will decline by 4\% (~80 Pg) on average when SOC reaches the steady state under 2$\,^{\circ}$C warming, assuming no changes in net primary productivity (NPP). To compensate such decline (i.e. maintain current SOC stocks), a 3\% increase of NPP is required. Without the downward SOC movement, global SOC declines by 15\%, while a 20\% increase in NPP is needed to compensate that loss. This vital role of downward SOC movement in controlling whole-soil profile SOC dynamics in response to warming is due to the protection afforded to downward-moving SOC by depth, indicated by much longer residence times of SOC in deeper layers. Additionally, we find that this protection could not be counteracted by promoted decomposition due to the priming of downward-moving new SOC from upper layers on native old SOC in deeper layers. This study provides the first estimation of whole-soil SOC changes under warming and additional NPP required to compensate such changes across the globe, and reveals the vital role of downward movement of SOC in reducing SOC loss under global warming.},

@article{Guo2023,
	abstract = {Abstract Soil biogeochemical processes may present depth-dependent responses to climate change, due to vertical environmental gradients (e.g., thermal and moisture regimes, and the quantity and quality of soil organic matter) along soil profile. However, it is a grand challenge to distinguish such depth dependence under field conditions. Here we present an innovative, cost-effective and simple approach of field incubation of intact soil cores to explore such depth dependence. The approach adopts field incubation of two sets of intact soil cores: one incubated right-side up (i.e., non-inverted), and another upside down (i.e., inverted). This inversion keeps soil intact but changes the depth of the soil layer of same depth origin. Combining reciprocal translocation experiments to generate natural climate shift, we applied this incubation approach along a 2200 m elevational mountainous transect in southeast Tibetan Plateau. We measured soil respiration (Rs) from non-inverted and inverted cores of 1 m deep, respectively, which were exchanged among and incubated at different elevations. The results indicated that Rs responds significantly (p < .05) to translocation-induced climate shifts, but this response is depth-independent. As the incubation proceeds, Rs from both non-inverted and inverted cores become more sensitive to climate shifts, indicating higher vulnerability of persistent soil organic matter (SOM) to climate change than labile components, if labile substrates are assumed to be depleted with the proceeding of incubation. These results show in situ evidence that whole-profile SOM mineralization is sensitive to climate change regardless of the depth location. Together with measurements of vertical physiochemical conditions, the inversion experiment can serve as an experimental platform to elucidate the depth dependence of the response of soil biogeochemical processes to climate change.},

@article{Pausch2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Despite its fundamental role for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, rhizodeposition remains `the hidden half of the hidden half': it is highly dynamic and rhizodeposits are rapidly incorporated into microorganisms, soil organic matter, and decomposed to CO2. Therefore, rhizodeposition is rarely quantified and remains the most uncertain part of the soil C cycle and of C fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. This review synthesizes and generalizes the literature on C inputs by rhizodeposition under crops and grasslands (281 data sets). The allocation dynamics of assimilated C (after 13C-CO2 or 14C-CO2 labeling of plants) were quantified within shoots, shoot respiration, roots, net rhizodeposition (i.e., C remaining in soil for longer periods), root-derived CO2, and microorganisms. Partitioning of C pools and fluxes were used to extrapolate belowground C inputs via rhizodeposition to ecosystem level. Allocation from shoots to roots reaches a maximum within the first day after C assimilation. Annual crops retained more C (45\% of assimilated 13C or 14C) in shoots than grasses (34\%), mainly perennials, and allocated 1.5 times less C belowground. For crops, belowground C allocation was maximal during the first 1--2 months of growth and decreased very fast thereafter. For grasses, it peaked after 2--4 months and remained very high within the second year causing much longer allocation periods. Despite higher belowground C allocation by grasses (33\%) than crops (21\%), its distribution between various belowground pools remains very similar. Hence, the total C allocated belowground depends on the plant species, but its further fate is species independent. This review demonstrates that C partitioning can be used in various approaches, e.g., root sampling, CO2 flux measurements, to assess rhizodeposits' pools and fluxes at pot, plot, field and ecosystem scale and so, to close the most uncertain gap of the terrestrial C cycle.},

@article{Amos2006,
	abstract = {Assessment of net primary productivity of maize (Zea mays L)-based agroecosystems is dependent on both above and belowground dry matter production that is ultimately returned to the soil as residue and decaying roots. Root to shoot ratio (R/S) is a parameter often used to estimate root biomass (RB) when shoot biomass is measured or estimated. The labor intensive nature of root sampling and wide variety of sampling techniques has lead to a paucity of maize RB data in the literature, and few researchers have endeavored to characterize R/S throughout an entire growing season. In this paper, the results of 45 maize root studies published in 41 journal articles are summarized and the data used to generate estimates of maize RB and R/S versus days after emergence (DAE). The data from these studies indicate that on average, RB was maximized just after anthesis at approximately 31 g plant−1 (13.6 g C plant−1) and that average R/S varied from a high of 0.68 at emergence to a low of 0.16 at physiological maturity. Net rhizodeposited C as a percentage of total net root-derived belowground C at time of sampling (\%NRC) was reported for 12 maize studies and varied between 5 and 62\%. The wide variation in the \%NRC was shown to be highly correlated with an index combining irradiance level, photoperiod, and ambient temperature, suggesting a strong dependence of net rhizodeposited C on rate of photosynthesis and soil respiration. The net belowground C deposition at maize physiological maturity is estimated as 29 $\pm$ 13\% of shoot biomass C for maize that has not experienced stress.},

	abstract = {Below ground carbon (BGC) inputs to soil, i.e. root biomass and rhizodeposition carbon (C), are among the most important variables driving soil C dynamics in agroecosystems. Hence, increasing BGC inputs to deep soil is a proposed strategy to sequester C in the long term. As BGC inputs are inherently difficult to measure in the field, they are usually estimated from yield in order to supply soil C models with input data. While fertilization intensity considerably affects above ground biomass, its influence on BGC inputs is largely unclear, especially with respect to the subsoil. Therefore, we determined net root biomass and rhizodeposition C of field-grown maize and wheat at harvest in different farming systems (bio-organic, conventional) and fertilization treatments (zero, manure, mineral) along an intensity gradient in two Swiss long-term field trials. Plants in microplots were repeatedly pulse-labelled with 13C-CO2 throughout the growing seasons and shoots, roots, and soil to 0.75 m depth were sampled at harvest. Despite a strong increase of above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity, BGC inputs were similar among treatments on both sites irrespective of soil depth. However, the proportions of rhizodeposition C of BGC inputs averaged 54 to 63% and were, therefore, much larger than the widely adopted 40% for field-grown cereals. They increased with soil depth and were highest under sole organic fertilization. The shift in whole-plant C allocation towards above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity entailed 10% higher C allocation below ground in organic than conventional farming for both maize and wheat. Our findings imply that yield-independent values provide closer estimates for BGC inputs to soil of cereals in different farming systems than yield-based functions. We further conclude that fertilization has only little potential to alter absolute amounts of BGC inputs to deep soil in order to sequester C in the long term.},

A database of 96 profiles was compiled and root distribution pattern were fitted to a modified logistic dose response curve for 11 temperate crops. A slight linear decrease between the root mass: length distribution ratio and the soil depth was found for monocotyledons while an exponential decrease with depth was found for dicotyledons. These results indicated that roots were thicker at upper soil layers with the effect much larger for dicotyledons. The estimated depth at which 50% of total root was accumulated for different crops varied from 8cm to 20cm. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) showed the deepest rooting profile with a fitted maximum rooting depth (dmax) of 177cm but another perennial, fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.), had the shallowest dmax of 78cm. In general, cereal and pulse crop roots were distributed more evenly in soil profile while more roots were accumulated in the upper soil layers for oilseed crops. The estimated root distribution patterns from the present study could be incorporated into agroecosystem models for good representations of belowground processes and enhance the accuracy of carbon and water cycling estimation in agroecosystem.},

@article{Bolinder2007,
	abstract = {The current interest in characterizing, predicting and managing soil C dynamics has focused attention on making estimates of C inputs to soil more accurate and precise. Net primary productivity (NPP) provides the inputs of carbon (C) in ecosystems and determines the amount of photosynthetically fixed C that can potentially be sequestered in soil organic matter. We present a method for estimating NPP and annual C inputs to soil for some common Canadian agroecosystems, using a series of plant C allocation coefficients for each crop type across the country. The root-derived C in these coefficients was estimated by reviewing studies reporting information on plant shoot-to-root (S:R) ratios (n=168). Mean S:R ratios for annual crops were highest for small-grain cereals (7.4), followed by corn (5.6) and soybeans (5.2), and lowest for forages (1.6). The review also showed considerable uncertainty (coefficient of variation for S:R ratios of ∼50% for annual crops and ∼75% for perennial forages) in estimating below-ground NPP (BNPP) in agroecosystems; uncertainty was similar to that for Canadian boreal forests. The BNPP (including extra-root C) was lower for annual crops (∼20% of NPP) than for perennial forages (∼50%). The latter was similar to estimates for relative below-ground C allocation in other Canadian natural ecosystems such as mixed grasslands and forests. The proposed method is easy to use, specific for particular crops, management practices, and driven by agronomic yields. It can be readily up-dated with new experimental results and measurements of parameters used to quantify the accumulation and distribution of photosynthetically fixed C in different types of crops.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter affects fundamental biogeochemical processes in the soil such as nutrient cycling and organic matter storage. The current paradigm is that processing of dissolved organic matter converges to recalcitrant molecules (those that resist degradation) of low molecular mass and high molecular diversity through biotic and abiotic processes. Here we demonstrate that the molecular composition and properties of dissolved organic matter continuously change during soil passage and propose that this reflects a continual shifting of its sources. Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we studied the molecular changes of dissolved organic matter from the soil surface to 60 cm depth in 20 temperate grassland communities in soil type Eutric Fluvisol. Applying a semi-quantitative approach, we observed that plant-derived molecules were first broken down into molecules containing a large proportion of low-molecular-mass compounds. These low-molecular-mass compounds became less abundant during soil passage, whereas larger molecules, depleted in plant-related ligno-cellulosic structures, became more abundant. These findings indicate that the small plant-derived molecules were preferentially consumed by microorganisms and transformed into larger microbial-derived molecules. This suggests that dissolved organic matter is not intrinsically recalcitrant but instead persists in soil as a result of simultaneous consumption, transformation and formation.},

	abstract = {Despite that dissolved organic matter (DOM) and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) represent only a small part of soil organic matter, they appear to be involved in many soil processes. This review intends to compile the current information on the influence of land use and management practices on soil DOM and WEOM, and to identify the gaps in our knowledge that sometimes preclude from drawing general conclusions. The literature on DOM and WEOM dynamics in different ecosystems is derived mainly from studies on temperate forest soils. Although less abundant, literature on temperate grassland and arable soils is also available, whereas very few studies have been published on tropical ecosystems. Similarly, studies on DOM and WEOM have focused mainly on the carbon fraction, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus have received much less attention. On the short term, temporal and spatial variations in DOM and WEOM are complex and influenced by environmental conditions. Laboratory studies have shown that management practices, such as liming and N fertilization, can induce marked fluctuations in DOM and WEOM. Under field conditions, however, the net effect of management practices often remains unclear because many soil properties, which can interact and counterbalance, are influenced at the same time. Changes in DOM and WEOM upon management practices are generally of short duration, whereas long-term effects are more related to vegetation type and to the amount of plant litter returned to the soil. So far, research on soil DOM and WEOM as influenced by land use and management practices has offered fragmented and sometimes contradictory information. It is concluded that the standardization of collection and extraction methods for DOM and WEOM measurements is crucial to reduce the uncertainty when comparing results from different studies. More research would also be required (i) under field conditions and especially in tropical ecosystems, (ii) to determine the biological significance of measured fluctuations in DOM and WEOM concentration and composition, and (iii) to elucidate the mechanisms determining DOM/WEOM dynamics following changes in land use and management practices.},

@article{Hilbert2000,
	abstract = {Summary 1 A general model of peatland dynamics is presented that emphasizes the interaction between water table depth and peat production. The model consists of two coupled, non-linear differential equations representing change in depth of peat and depth to the water table. Several simplified models are also considered to show the logical development of this model from previously published ones. The model provides an integrated view of how peatlands function over long time scales, by focusing on the non-linear interactions among peat production, decomposition and hydrology. 2 Analysis of the model shows that equilibrium peat accumulation and water table depth depend on the net water input to the peatland. In drier sites, peatlands with relatively deep water tables develop and the equilibrium peat depth increases with increasing water input. In very wet conditions, peatlands have water tables near the surface, peat accumulation is limited by low production rates, and equilibrium peat depth is lower than is possible in comparatively drier sites. Over a range of intermediate water balances, there are two simultaneous equilibrium states where deep, dry peatlands and shallower, wet peatlands can both occur. This sensitivity to water balance suggests that small changes in precipitation regime, such as are expected with climate variability and change, could rapidly convert peatlands that are now in equilibrium into either sources or sinks of carbon.},

@article{Heckman2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the controls on the amount and persistence of soil organic carbon (C) is essential for predicting its sensitivity to global change. The response may depend on whether C is unprotected, isolated within aggregates, or protected from decomposition by mineral associations. Here, we present a global synthesis of the relative influence of environmental factors on soil organic C partitioning among pools, abundance in each pool (mg C g−1 soil), and persistence (as approximated by radiocarbon abundance) in relatively unprotected particulate and protected mineral-bound pools. We show that C within particulate and mineral-associated pools consistently differed from one another in degree of persistence and relationship to environmental factors. Soil depth was the best predictor of C abundance and persistence, though it accounted for more variance in persistence. Persistence of all C pools decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) throughout the soil profile, whereas persistence increased with increasing wetness index (MAP/PET) in subsurface soils (30--176 cm). The relationship of C abundance (mg C g−1 soil) to climate varied among pools and with depth. Mineral-associated C in surface soils (<30 cm) increased more strongly with increasing wetness index than the free particulate C, but both pools showed attenuated responses to the wetness index at depth. Overall, these relationships suggest a strong influence of climate on soil C properties, and a potential loss of soil C from protected pools in areas with decreasing wetness. Relative persistence and abundance of C pools varied significantly among land cover types and soil parent material lithologies. This variability in each pool's relationship to environmental factors suggests that not all soil organic C is equally vulnerable to global change. Therefore, projections of future soil organic C based on patterns and responses of bulk soil organic C may be misleading.},

	abstract = {The question of why some types of organic matter are more persistent while others decompose quickly in soils has motivated a large amount of research in recent years. Persistence is commonly characterized as turnover or mean residence time of soil organic matter (SOM). However, turnover and residence times are ambiguous measures of persistence, because they could represent the concept of either age or transit time. To disambiguate these concepts and propose a metric to assess SOM persistence, we calculated age and transit time distributions for a wide range of soil organic carbon models. Furthermore, we show how age and transit time distributions can be obtained from a stochastic approach that takes a deterministic model of mass transfers among different pools and creates an equivalent stochastic model at the level of atoms. Using this approach we show the following: (1) Age distributions have relatively old mean values and long tails in relation to transit time distributions, suggesting that carbon stored in soils is on average much older than carbon in the release flux. (2) The difference between mean ages and mean transit times is large, with estimates of soil organic carbon persistence on the order of centuries or millennia when assessed using ages and on the order of decades when using transit or turnover times. (3) The age distribution is an appropriate metric to characterize persistence of SOM. An important implication of our analysis is that random chance is a factor that helps to explain why some organic matter persists for millennia in soil.},

However, present estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of soils are based more on what is happening now than what might be changed by active agricultural intervention, and tend to concentrate only on the first metre of soil depth.Breeding crop plants with deeper and bushy root ecosystems could simultaneously improve both the soil structure and its steady-state carbon, water and nutrient retention, as well as sustainable plant yields. The carbon that can be sequestered in the steady state by increasing the rooting depths of crop plants and grasses from, say, 1 m to 2 m depends significantly on its lifetime(s) in different molecular forms in the soil, but calculations (http://dbkgroup.org/carbonsequestration/rootsystem.html) suggest that this breeding strategy could have a hugely beneficial effect in stabilizing atmospheric CO2.

However, a fraction of Iroot may lose quickly (Iloss, e.g., via rhizosphere microbial respiration, leaching and fauna feeding) without contributing to long-term bulk soil C storage, yet this loss has never been quantified, particularly on a global scale. In this study we integrated three observational global data sets including soil radiocarbon content, allocation of photosynthetically assimilated C, and root biomass distribution in 2,034 soil profiles to quantify Iroot and its contribution to the bulk soil C pool. We show that global average Iroot in the 0--200 cm soil profile is 3.5 Mg ha−1 yr−1, ∼80{\%} of which (i.e., Iloss) is lost rather than contributing to long-term bulk soil C storage. Iroot decreases exponentially with soil depth, and the top 20 cm soil contains >60{\%} of total Iroot. Actual C input contributing to long-term bulk soil storage (i.e., Iroot−Iloss) shows a similar depth distribution to Iroot. We also map Iloss and its depth distribution across the globe. Our results demonstrate the global significance of direct C losses which limit the contribution of Iroot to bulk soil C storage; and provide spatially explicit data to facilitate reliable soil C predictions via separating direct C losses from total root-derived C inputs.},

	abstract = {Although soils have a high potential to offset CO2 emissions through its conversion into soil organic carbon (SOC) with long turnover time, it is widely accepted that there is an upper limit of soil stable C storage, which is referred to SOC saturation. In this study we estimate SOC saturation in French topsoil (0--30cm) and subsoil (30--50cm), using the Hassink equation and calculate the additional SOC sequestration potential (SOCsp) by the difference between SOC saturation and fine fraction C on an unbiased sampling set of sites covering whole mainland France. We then map with fine resolution the geographical distribution of SOCsp over the French territory using a regression Kriging approach with environmental covariates. Results show that the controlling factors of SOCsp differ from topsoil and subsoil. The main controlling factor of SOCsp in topsoils is land use. Nearly half of forest topsoils are over-saturated with a SOCsp close to 0 (mean and standard error at 0.19$\pm$0.12) whereas cropland, vineyard and orchard soils are largely unsaturated with degrees of C saturation deficit at 36.45$\pm$0.68% and 57.10$\pm$1.64%, respectively. The determinant of C sequestration potential in subsoils is related to parent material. There is a large additional SOCsp in subsoil for all land uses with degrees of C saturation deficit between 48.52$\pm$4.83% and 68.68$\pm$0.42%. Overall the SOCsp for French soils appears to be very large (1008Mt C for topsoil and 1360Mt C for subsoil) when compared to previous total SOC stocks estimates of about 3.5Gt in French topsoil.

@article{Kautz2013,
	abstract = {In arable farming systems, the term `subsoil' refers to the soil beneath the tilled or formerly tilled soil horizon whereas the latter one is denoted as `topsoil'. To date, most agronomic and plant nutrition studies have widely neglected subsoil processes involved in nutrient acquisition by crop roots. Based on our current knowledge it can be assumed that subsoil properties such as comparatively high bulk density, low air permeability, and poverty of organic matter, nutrients and microbial biomass are obviously adverse for nutrient acquisition, and sometimes subsoils provide as little as less than 10% of annual nutrient uptake in fertilised arable fields. Nevertheless, there is also strong evidence indicating that subsoil can contribute to more than two-thirds of the plant nutrition of N, P and K, especially when the topsoil is dry or nutrient-depleted. Based on the existing literature, nutrient acquisition from arable subsoils may be conceptualised into three major process components: (I) mobilisation from the subsoil, (II) translocation to the shoot and long-term accumulation in the Ap horizon and (III) re-allocation to the subsoil. The quantitative estimation of nutrient acquisition from the subsoil requires the linking of field experiments with mathematical modelling approaches on different spatial scales including Process Based Models for the field scale and Functional--Structural Plant Models for the plant scale. Possibilities to modify subsoil properties by means of agronomic management are limited, but `subsoiling' -- i.e. deep mechanical loosening -- as well as the promotion of biopore formation are two potential strategies for increasing access to subsoil resources for crop roots in arable soils. The quantitative role of biopores in the nutrient acquisition from the subsoil is still unclear, and more research is needed to determine the bioaccessibility of nutrients in subsoil horizons.},

	abstract = {Recent initiatives, such as the United Nations declaring 2015 as the International Year of Soils and the French « 4 per 1000 » initiative call attention on soils and on the importance of maintaining and increasing soil organic matter stocks for soil fertility and food security, and for climate change adaptation and mitigation. We stress that soil organic carbon storage (i.e. an increase of soil organic carbon stocks) should be clearly differentiated from soil organic carbon sequestration, as the latter assumes a net removal of atmospheric CO2. Implementing management options that allow increasing soil organic carbon stocks at the local scale raises several questions, which are discussed in this article: how can we increase SOC stocks, at which rate and for how long; where do we prioritize SOC storage; how do we estimate the potential gain in C and which agricultural practices should we implement? We show that knowledge and tools are available to answer many of these questions, while further research remains necessary for others. A range of agricultural practices would require a re-assessment of their potential to store C and a better understanding of the underlying processes, such as no tillage and conservation agriculture, irrigation, practices increasing below ground inputs, organic amendments, and N fertilization. The vision emerging from the literature, showing the prominent role of soil microorganisms in the stabilization of soil organic matter, draw the attention to more exploratory potential levers, through changes in microbial physiology or soil biodiversity induced by agricultural practices, that require in-depth research.},

@article{Lorenz2005,
	abstract = {Routine soil surveys for estimating the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool account for a soil depth of about 1 m. Deeper soil horizons, however, may have a high capacity to sequester significant amounts of SOC as the turnover time and chemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter (SOM) increases with depth. The subsoil carbon (C) sequestration may be achieved by higher inputs of fairly stable organic matter to deeper soil horizons. This can be achieved directly by selecting plants/cultivars with deeper and thicker root systems that are high in chemical recalcitrant compounds like suberin. Furthermore, recalcitrant compounds could be a target for plant breeding/biotechnology to promote C sequestration. A high surface input of organic matter favors the production of dissolved organic carbon that can be transported to deeper soil horizons and thus contribute to the subsoil C storage. By promoting the activity of the soil fauna, organic matter can be transferred to deeper soil layers and stabilized (e.g., in earthworm casts). Manipulating the subsoil microorganisms may result in higher amounts of fairly stable aliphatic compounds. The subsoil below 1‐m depth may have the potential to sequester between 760 and 1520 Pg C. These estimates are, however, highly uncertain and more studies on C storage in subsoil horizons and the assessment of the chemical nature of subsoil organic C are needed.},

@article{Button2022,
	abstract = {Due to their substantial volume, subsoils contain more of the total soil carbon (C) pool than topsoils. Much of this C is thousands of years old, suggesting that subsoils offer considerable potential for long-term C sequestration. However, knowledge of subsoil C behaviour and manageability remains incomplete, and subsoil C storage potential has yet to be realised at a large scale, particularly in agricultural systems. A range of biological (e.g. deep-rooting), chemical (e.g. biochar burial) and physical (e.g. deep ploughing) C sequestration strategies have been proposed, but are yet to be assessed. In this review, we identify the main factors that regulate subsoil C cycling and critically evaluate the evidence and mechanistic basis of subsoil strategies designed to promote greater C storage, with particular emphasis on agroecosystems. We assess the barriers and opportunities for the implementation of strategies to enhance subsoil C sequestration and identify 5 key current gaps in scientific understanding. We conclude that subsoils, while highly heterogeneous, are in many cases more suited to long-term C sequestration than topsoils. The proposed strategies may also bring other tangible benefits to cropping systems (e.g. enhanced water holding capacity and nutrient use efficiency). Furthermore, while the subsoil C sequestration strategies we reviewed have large potential, more long-term studies are needed across a diverse range of soils and climates, in conjunction with chronosequence and space-for-time substitutions. Also, it is vital that subsoils are more consistently included in modelled estimations of soil C stocks and C sequestration potential, and that subsoil-explicit C models are developed to specifically reflect subsoil processes. Finally, further mapping of subsoil C is needed in specific regions (e.g. in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, South and Central America, South Asia and Africa). Conducting both immediate and long-term subsoil C studies will fill the knowledge gaps to devise appropriate soil C sequestration strategies and policies to help in the global fight against climate change and decline in soil quality. In conclusion, our evidence-based analysis reveals that subsoils offer an untapped potential to enhance global C storage in terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Land-use changes (LUC) influence the balance of soil organic carbon (SOC) and hence may cause CO2 emissions or sequestration. In Europe there is a side by side of LUC types that lead to SOC loss or SOC accumulation. However, there is a lack of studies covering all major LUC types to investigate qualitative and quantitative LUC effects on SOC. In this study we sampled 24 paired sites in Europe to a depth of 80cm, covering a wide range of pedo-climatic conditions and comprising the major European LUC types cropland to grassland, grassland to cropland, cropland to forest and grassland to forest. To assess qualitative changes and the sensitivity of different functional SOC pools with distinct turnover times, we conducted a fractionation to isolate five different fractions of SOC. The mean SOC stock changes after LUC were 18$\pm$11Mgha−1 (cropland to grassland), 21$\pm$13Mgha−1 (cropland to forest), −19$\pm$7Mgha−1 (grassland to cropland) and −10$\pm$7Mgha−1 (grassland to forest) with the main changes occurring in the topsoil (0--30cm depth). However, subsoil carbon stocks (>30cm depth) were also affected by LUC, at 19 out of 24 sites in the same direction as the topsoil. LUC promoting subsoil SOC accumulation might be a sustainable C sink. Particulate organic matter (POM) was found to be most sensitive to LUC. After cropland afforestation, POM accounted for 50% (9.1$\pm$2.3Mgha−1) of the sequestered carbon in 0--30cm: after grassland afforestation POM increased on average by 5$\pm$2.3Mgha−1, while all other fractions depleted. Thus, afforestations shift SOC from stable to labile pools. The resistant fraction comprising the so‐called inert carbon was found to be only slightly less sensitive than the total SOC pool, suggesting that an inert carbon pool was not chemically extracted with NaOCl oxidation, if there is any inert carbon.},

	abstract = {Abstract The effects of land use change on soil carbon stocks are of concern in the context of international policy agendas on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (−10\%), native forest to plantation (−13\%), native forest to crop (−42\%), and pasture to crop (−59\%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture (+ 8\%), crop to pasture (+ 19\%), crop to plantation (+ 18\%), and crop to secondary forest (+ 53\%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12--15\%.},

	abstract = {The depth of sampling has recently been highlighted as critical to making accurate measurements of changes in SOC stocks. This paper aimed to determine the effects of land management changes (LMC) on soil organic carbon (SOC) by re-sampling long-term agoecosystem experiments (LTAEs) across Canada using identical sampling and laboratory protocols. The impact of sampling depth on the monitoring of LMC-induced differences in SOC stock in LTAEs in Canada, and the implications on statistical power and sampling design, were assessed. In most cases, four cores would be suitable for detecting a significant difference in SOC stock of 5 Mg ha−1 at 95\% confidence for LMCs in western Canada. The impact of eliminating fallow on SOC stocks was typically restricted to the surface 15 cm. The impact of perennial forages on the average cumulative SOC was sufficiently large to be detectable at all sampling depths (to 60 cm). In three of the six LTAEs sampled in western Canada comparing conventional tillage to no-till, there was a significantly greater SOC storage in the 0- to 30-depth than the 0- to 15-cm depth, suggesting that sampling below 15 cm could be necessary. The same comparisons in eastern Canada suggested that sampling often must exceed the 30-cm depth to account for any changes in SOC due to moldboard plow tillage. Nonetheless, there was little evidence to suggest that increasing sampling intensity or sampling deeper would improve the ability to detect a difference in SOC stocks for this LMC.},

Assessments of how much C will be lost or sequestered into soil and the turnover rates of that C are needed to assist producers and policymakers in determining the long-term sustainability of biomass production. We used the natural 13C abundance of soils to calculate the quantity and turnover of C4−C inputs in irrigated fields cropped to switchgrass monocultures. Soil profile root biomass produced after three seasons averaged 3.9 Mg C ha−1 m−1 Five years of cropping showed a 1200 kg ha−1 increase in soil organic C (SOC) in the 0- to 15-cm depth increment, with no change below 15 cm. The surface 15 cm of soil cropped to `Kanlow' and `Shawnee' had a δ13C enrichment of 3‰ above the native uncultivated soil, with 3.6‰ for `Cave in Rock,' with an average 2‰ enrichment compared with the soil collected before switchgrass establishment. Enrichment in the 30- to 60- and 60- to 90-cm depths averaged 1.7 and 0.9‰, respectively. The amount of soil profile C4--C determined by δ13C analysis showed a greater C input than determined by the difference in total C mass between the uncultivated native and cropped soils. The average accrual rate of C4--SOC was estimated at 1.0 Mg ha−1 yr−1 Estimates of the mean residence time of the C3−C under the irrigated C4 monocultures of switchgrass were >60 yr in the 0- to15-cm and 30 to 55 yr in the 15- to 30-cm depth increments. On average, 24\% of SOC in the 0- to 15-cm depth was derived from C4 cropping.},

	abstract = {Compared to annual crops, the use of deep-rooted vegetation, such as perennial grasses, in agricultural systems can increase soil organic C (SOC) storage deep within the soil profile. However, this potential increase could be adversely influenced by physical limitations in the soil profile. Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum Schreb.) was grown for 7 years after a long-term tillage experiment on a fine sandy loam (Orthic Podzol) in Prince Edward Island which had naturally compacted subsoil. Soil samples from the 0--60cm soil depth (divided into five depth increments) were collected periodically from 2000 to 2007 to evaluate the potential for tall fescue to increase SOC and total N (TN) storage and depth distribution in the soil profile, especially in subsurface soil layers. Light fraction C (LF-C) and particulate organic matter C (POM-C) were also evaluated as indicators of SOC change in the soil profile. Annual tall fescue biomass yield (>7Mgdry matterha−1) was above regional norms, but rooting depth (70--90cm) was relatively shallow. Comparison of the 2000 and 2007 data showed that tall fescue increased SOC and TN in the 0--10 and 40--60cm soil depths. Over the 0--60cm soil depth, SOC content increased by 23% and TN by 34%. Use of the equivalent soil mass approach, to adjust for soil bulk density increases over the 7-year period, reduced the SOC gain to 17% (increase of 12.8MgCha−1). This SOC increase corresponded with standard decomposition calculations based on plant biomass inputs. Both LF-C and POM-C indicated that tall fescue increased SOC down the soil profile. This research demonstrates the important role that plant roots which play in SOC storage deep within the soil profile, even when soil profile conditions may adversely influence rooting depth.},

To test this, we sampled soils to between 1- and 3-m depth at three sites in Oklahoma with 10- to 20-year-old switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) stands, and collected paired samples from nearby fields cultivated with shallow rooted annual crops. We measured root biomass, total organic C, 14C, 13C, and other soil properties in three replicate soil cores in each field and used a mixing model to estimate the proportion of recently fixed C under switchgrass based on 14C. The subsoil C stock under switchgrass (defined over 500--1500 kg/m2 equivalent soil mass, approximately 30--100 cm depth) exceeded the subsoil stock in neighboring fields by 1.5 kg C/m2 at a sandy loam site, 0.6 kg C/m2 at a site with loam soils, and showed no significant difference at a third site with clay soils. Using the mixing model, we estimated that additional SOC introduced after switchgrass cultivation comprised 31\% of the subsoil C stock at the sandy loam site, 22\% at the loam site, and 0\% at the clay site. These results suggest that switchgrass can contribute significantly to subsoil organic C---but also indicated that this effect varies across sites. Our analysis shows that agricultural strategies that emphasize deep-rooted grass cultivars can increase soil C relative to conventional crops while expanding energy biomass production on marginal lands.},

	abstract = {The significant contribution to the global carbon budget made by soil organic carbon (SOC) inspired the ``4 per 1000'' initiative. It promotes agricultural practices aimed at raising SOC stocks 0.4 % annually over 20 years. However, the response of topsoil and deep soil profiles to agroecosystem changes is largely unknown at present. Our work aims to quantify deep SOC accumulations in stabilized croplands and grasslands of northeast Italy and identify the best management practices to increase those stores. Soil profiles were collected to 70 and 90 cm depths from three well-established long-term experiments. A total of 1242 soil samples were analyzed for SOC concentrations as a function of soil type, soil management practice, and cropping system. SOC stocks were quantified using the equivalent soil mass method. Results show that SOC stocks averaged 23.2 Mg ha−1 in sandy Arenosol, 59.3 Mg ha−1 in silty loam Cambisol, 111.6 Mg ha−1 in clay loam Gleysol, and 383.5 Mg ha−1 in peaty Histosol. Substantial SOC stocks were found in the subsoil beneath the tilled layer, ranging between 59 % and 74 % in sandy and clay loam soils. Among the considered managements, the SOC accumulation rate of permanent meadow topsoil was higher than croplands (0.299 Mg ha−1 yr−1), which fell to 0.256 Mg ha−1 yr−1 when estimated along the full soil profile. In contrast, organic carbon added through manures and residues, coupled with minimum tillage practices, led to increased average SOC stock rates in the topsoil (0.205 Mg ha−1 yr−1) and throughout the full soil profile (0.386 Mg ha−1 yr−1), suggesting that some translocation dynamics occurred. The long-term adoption of permanent meadow, along with manure or residue addition under minimum tillage, made it possible to achieve ``4 per 1000'' goals to great depths in naturally poor-SOC sandy and silty loam soils. In SOC-rich soil, only in the topsoil layer achieved this.},

	abstract = {Soil organic C (SOC) in agricultural soils is affected by cropping system. In order to compare the impact of ley-dominated and cereal monoculture rotations on soil properties, a series of experiments was started in Sweden in the early 1980s. This study quantified the effect of rotations and N fertilisation on SOC stocks and microbial community composition. After 35 years, soil samples taken down to 50-cm depth at two sites with contrasting soil texture (clay and loam) were analysed for soil C and N, bulk density and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) content. Significant increases in SOC concentrations and stocks were found in the ley-dominated rotation compared with the cereal monoculture rotation, the difference being 0.36 and 0.59 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in the topsoil (0--20 cm) for sites with the clay and loam texture, respectively, in average over N fertiliser levels. Nitrogen fertilisation increased SOC stocks significantly in the cereal monoculture, but not in the ley-dominated rotation. In the loam, SOC responses in the subsoil were almost as high as those in the topsoil, but they were insignificant in the clay soil. These results indicate that soil texture and structure can have a great impact on the potential of subsoils to sequester C, which requires attention when scaling up SOC sequestration rates for regional or global assessments.},

	abstract = {The effects of 13 years of biennial application of four organic amendments (compost, green manure, farmyard manure and sewage sludge) on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, microbial biomass and community structure were compared with those of bare fallow, an unfertilised control and N-fertilised treatments. The experiment was conducted on a clay soil in western Sweden, in a randomised block design with four replicates. The crops grown were spring barley and oats. Changes in SOC mass were estimated by the `equivalent soil mass' concept. Carbon inputs from crops were calculated from grain yields using linear allometric functions. The decomposition rate of soil organic matter was derived from a bare fallow treatment. Humification coefficients, defined here as the fraction of C input entering the SOC pool, for the organic amendments and crop residues were estimated by fitting a single-pool first order model to the final SOC stocks. The humification coefficient was highest for domestic waste compost (0.9) and lowest for above-ground crop residues (0.19). Crop yields were highest in sewage sludge-amended soil, probably due to favourable physical soil conditions, as indicated by lower bulk density (1.27--1.30gcm−3) than in the other treatments (1.32--1.38gcm−3). Despite addition of relatively high amounts of organic N, yields in other treatments receiving organic amendments were significantly lower than in those receiving mineral N fertiliser. In particular, the compost material was found to be highly recalcitrant, as indicated by its low C/N ratio (10) and low crop yield. Comparison of the correlation between phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration and SOC showed that compost supported relatively less microbial biomass than the other substrates tested. An important finding was that differences in SOC between treatments were significant to 40cm depth and that up to 27% of the SOC changes observed to 40cm depth occurred in the upper subsoil (25--40cm). Thus, SOC changes below ploughing depth should be considered in SOC balance studies.},

@article{Menichetti2015,
	abstract = {The contribution of different C inputs to organic carbon accumulation within the soil profile in the Ultuna long-term continuous soil organic matter experiment, established in 1956, was determined. Until 1999, C3-crops were grown at the site, but since then maize (C4) has been the only crop. The effect of a total of 10 different inorganic nitrogen and organic amendment treatments (4Mg Cha−1yr−1) on SOC in topsoil and subsoil after 53 years was evaluated and the contribution from maize roots to SOC after 10 years of cultivation was estimated. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and δ13C signature were measured down to 50cm depth. The C content in the topsoil (0--20cm depth) was 1.5% at the start of the experiment. After 53 years of treatments, the average topsoil C content varied between 0.9 and 3.8% of soil dry weight, with the open fallow having the lowest and the peat amended the highest value. Nitrogen seemed to promote C accumulation in the topsoil treatment effects were smaller below 20cm depth and only two of the amendments (peat and sewage sludge) significantly affected SOC content down to 35cm depth. Despite this, penetrometer measurements showed significant treatment differences of compaction below 41cm depth, and although we could not explain these differences this presented some evidence of an initial treatment-induced subsoil differentiation. Ten years of maize growth affected the δ13C of SOC down to 22.5cm depth, where it varied between −25.16 and −26.33(‰), and an isotopic mass balance calculation suggested that maize C accounted for 4--8% of total SOC in the topsoil. Until less than 2500 years ago the site was a post-glacial sea floor and the 14C data suggest that marine sediment C still dominates the SOC in deeper soil layers. Overall, the results suggest that 53 years of treatments has caused dramatic changes on the stored C in the topsoil in several of the treatments, while the changes in the subsoil is much less dramatic and a small C accumulation in the upper subsoil was found in two of the treatments. The contribution from roots to SOC accumulation was generally equal to or greater than the contribution from amendments. The retention coefficient of root-derived C in the topsoil was on average 0.30$\pm$0.09, which is higher than usually reported in the literature for plant residues but confirms previous findings for the same experiment using another approach. This strengthens the conclusion that root-derived SOC contributed more to SOC than above-ground crop residues.},

	abstract = {International initiatives are emphasizing the capture of atmospheric CO2 in soil organic C (SOC) to reduce the climatic footprint from agroecosystems. One approach to quantify the contribution of management practices towards that goal is through analysis of long-term experiments (LTEs). Our objectives were to analyze knowledge gained in literature reviews on SOC changes in LTEs, to evaluate the results regarding interactions with pedo-climatological factors, and to discuss disparities among reviews in data selection criteria. We summarized mean response ratios (RRs) and stock change rate (SCR) effect size indices from twenty reviews using paired comparisons (N). The highest RRs were found with manure applications (30{\%}, N = 418), followed by aboveground crop residue retention and the use of cover crops (9--10{\%}, N = 995 and 129), while the effect of nitrogen fertilization was lowest (6{\%}, N = 846). SCR for nitrogen fertilization exceeded that for aboveground crop residue retention (233 versus 117 kg C ha−1 year−1, N = 183 and 279) and was highest for manure applications and cover crops (409 and 331 kg C ha−1 year−1, N = 217 and 176). When data allows, we recommend calculating both RR and SCR because it improves the interpretation. Our synthesis shows that results are not always consistent among reviews and that interaction with texture and climate remain inconclusive. Selection criteria for study durations are highly variable, resulting in irregular conclusions for the effect of time on changes in SOC. We also discuss the relationships of SOC changes with yield and cropping systems, as well as conceptual problems when scaling-up results obtained from field studies to regional levels.},

	abstract = {The subsoil, commonly defined as horizons below the working depth of 30 cm, often receives little attention in farming practice. Yet plants extract between 10 and 80% of their nutrient and water requirements from the subsoil. Recent research indicates that subsoil amelioration measures, which enhance water storage capacity, root penetration and microbial activity, could contribute to stabilizing yields in times of drought. Therefore, we investigated farmers' and other soil experts' perceptions of subsoil amelioration as an approach to adapt to climate change as well as the factors that influence their willingness to adopt specific measures to improve the subsoil. We applied the Q-method combined with focus groups in two case study regions in Germany. Two subsoil amelioration techniques were considered: (1) Deep loosening combined with the incorporation of compost into deep soil layers (30--60 cm) and (2) the cultivation of alfalfa as deep-rooting pre-crop. Our results show three distinct views on subsoil amelioration, which we termed as the ``pioneers,'' the ``skeptics,'' and the ``ecologists.'' While the pioneers were open toward applying deep loosening combined with incorporation of compost into the subsoil, the skeptics had concerns about the method and perceived it as hardly feasible in practice, and the ecologists clearly preferred biological approaches such as alfalfa cultivation. Despite the different views, all three perspectives view subsoil amelioration as a useful approach to adapt to changing climate conditions. In conclusion, we identified a number of factors that influence the willingness to implement specific techniques to improve the subsoil: economic and farm-level considerations, awareness of subsoil functions, environmental awareness, individual norms and beliefs as well as risk perception. We recommend considering these factors in the design of a policy framework that promotes subsoil amelioration in Germany. Our findings could be of relevance for agricultural systems around the world, which are prone to drought risk.},

	abstract = {The exchange of carbon between soil organic carbon (SOC) and the atmosphere affects the climate1,2 and---because of the importance of organic matter to soil fertility---agricultural productivity3. The dynamics of topsoil carbon has been relatively well quantified4, but half of the soil carbon is located in deeper soil layers (below 30 centimetres)5--7, and many questions remain regarding the exchange of this deep carbon with the atmosphere8. This knowledge gap restricts soil carbon management policies and limits global carbon models1,9,10. Here we quantify the recent incorporation of atmosphere-derived carbon atoms into whole-soil profiles, through a meta-analysis of changes in stable carbon isotope signatures at 112 grassland, forest and cropland sites, across different climatic zones, from 1965 to 2015. We find, in agreement with previous work5,6, that soil at a depth of 30--100 centimetres beneath the surface (the subsoil) contains on average 47 per cent of the topmost metre's SOC stocks. However, we show that this subsoil accounts for just 19 per cent of the SOC that has been recently incorporated (within the past 50 years) into the topmost metre. Globally, the median depth of recent carbon incorporation into mineral soil is 10 centimetres. Variations in the relative allocation of carbon to deep soil layers are better explained by the aridity index than by mean annual temperature. Land use for crops reduces the incorporation of carbon into the soil surface layer, but not into deeper layers. Our results suggest that SOC dynamics and its responses to climatic control or land use are strongly dependent on soil depth. We propose that using multilayer soil modules in global carbon models, tested with our data, could help to improve our understanding of soil--atmosphere carbon exchange.},

	abstract = {Improved quantification of the factors controlling soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization at continental to global scales is needed to inform projections of the largest actively cycling terrestrial carbon pool on Earth, and its response to environmental change. Biogeochemical models rely almost exclusively on clay content to modify rates of SOM turnover and fluxes of climate-active CO2 to the atmosphere. Emerging conceptual understanding, however, suggests other soil physicochemical properties may predict SOM stabilization better than clay content. We addressed this discrepancy by synthesizing data from over 5,500 soil profiles spanning continental scale environmental gradients. Here, we demonstrate that other physicochemical parameters are much stronger predictors of SOM content, with clay content having relatively little explanatory power. We show that exchangeable calcium strongly predicted SOM content in water-limited, alkaline soils, whereas with increasing moisture availability and acidity, iron- and aluminum-oxyhydroxides emerged as better predictors, demonstrating that the relative importance of SOM stabilization mechanisms scales with climate and acidity. These results highlight the urgent need to modify biogeochemical models to better reflect the role of soil physicochemical properties in SOM cycling.},

	abstract = {Abstract The response of soil carbon dynamics to climate and land-use change will affect both the future climate and the quality of ecosystems. Deep soil carbon (>20 cm) is the primary component of the soil carbon pool, but the dynamics of deep soil carbon remain poorly understood. Therefore, radiocarbon activity (C), which is a function of the age of carbon, may help to understand the rates of soil carbon biodegradation and stabilization. We analyzed the published C contents in 122 profiles of mineral soil that were well distributed in most of the large world biomes, except for the boreal zone. With a multivariate extension of a linear mixed-effects model whose inference was based on the parallel combination of two algorithms, the expectation--maximization (EM) and the Metropolis--Hasting algorithms, we expressed soil C profiles as a four-parameter function of depth. The four-parameter model produced insightful predictions of soil C as dependent on depth, soil type, climate, vegetation, land-use and date of sampling (). Further analysis with the model showed that the age of topsoil carbon was primarily affected by climate and cultivation. By contrast, the age of deep soil carbon was affected more by soil taxa than by climate and thus illustrated the strong dependence of soil carbon dynamics on other pedologic traits such as clay content and mineralogy.},

Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used 14C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil carbon by a factor of more than six (430 {\textpm} 50 years versus 3100 {\textpm} 1800 years).

@article{Xiao2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Abstract Soil carbon (C) is comprised of a continuum of organic compounds with distinct ages (i.e., the time a C atom has experienced in soil since the C atom entered soil). The contribution of different age groups to soil C efflux is critical for understanding soil C stability and persistence, but is poorly understood due to the complexity of soil C pool age structure and potential distinct turnover behaviors of age groups. Here we build upon quantification of soil C transit times to infer the age of C atoms in soil C efflux (aefflux) from seven sequential soil layer depths down to 2 m at a global scale, and compare this age with radiocarbon-inferred ages of C retained in corresponding soil layers (asoil). In the whole 0--2 m soil profile, the mean aefflux is 194211021 (mean with 5--95\% quantiles) yr, and is just about one-eighth of asoil (14767172547 yr), demonstrating that younger C dominates soil C efflux. With increasing soil depth, both aefflux and asoil are increased, but their disparities are markedly narrowed. That is, the proportional contribution of relatively younger soil C to efflux is decreased in deeper layers, demonstrating that C inputs (new and young) stay longer in deeper layers. Across the globe, we find large spatial variability of the contribution of soil C age groups to C efflux. Especially, in deep soil layers of cold regions (e.g., boreal forests and tundra), aefflux may be older than asoil, suggesting that older C dominates C efflux only under a limited range of conditions. These results imply that most C inputs may not contribute to long-term soil C storage, particularly in upper layers that hold the majority of new C inputs.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to better understand the mechanisms for soil organic matter delivery to and accumulation in mineral horizons of tropical rain forest, volcanic soils. We used soil morphology, lysimetry, isotopes, and spectroscopy to investigate the role of preferential flow paths in the delivery of carbon (C) to the subsoil. High rainfall, high primary productivity, and the dominance of highly reactive, short-range-order minerals combine to sequester substantial stocks of soil C with long mean residence times. The soils have large peds, separated by wide cracks, which form a network of channels propagating downward through the top 40 to 60 cm, facilitating macropore flow. The channel infillings and crack surfaces were enriched in organic material (OM) with lower C:N ratios, and had higher ammonium oxalate-extractable Al, and lower ammonium oxalate-extractable Fe than the adjacent mineral bulk soil. CP MAS 13C-NMR spectra of OM accumulating at depth showed strong signal intensities in the carboxyl and carbonyl C regions, indicative of organic acids, while decaying roots showed greater contributions of aromatic and O-alkyl C. The ratios of alkyl-to-O-alkyl C in the organic infillings were more similar to those of the bulk Bh and to dissolved organic matter than to those of decaying roots. Radiocarbon-based ages of OM infillings at >50 cm depth were significantly younger than the mineral soil (2000 years versus 7000 years). Respired CO2 from incubated soils showed that OM accumulating at depth is a mixture of modern and much older C, providing further evidence for the downward movement of fresh C.},

	abstract = {Abstract Tropical forests fix large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere every year; however, the fate of this carbon as it travels through ecosystem compartments is poorly understood. In particular, there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the time carbon spends in an ecosystem before it is respired and returns to the atmosphere as . We estimated the fate of carbon (trajectory of photosynthetically fixed carbon through a network of compartments) and its transit time (time it takes carbon to pass through the entire ecosystem, from fixation to respiration) for an old-growth tropical forest located in the foothills of the Andes of Colombia. We show that on average, 50\% of the carbon fixed at any given time is respired in  years, and 95\% is respired in  years. The transit time distribution shows that carbon in ecosystems is respired on a range of time-scales that span decades, but fast metabolic processes in vegetation dominate the return of carbon to the atmosphere. Synthesis. The transit time distribution integrates multiple ecosystem processes occurring at a wide range of time-scales. It reconciles measurements of the age of respired with estimates of mean residence time in woody biomass, and provides a new approach to interpret other ecosystem level metrics such as the ratio of net primary production to gross primary production.},

@article{Gill2000,
	abstract = {Root turnover is a critical component of ecosystem nutrient dynamics and carbon sequestration and is also an important sink for plant primary productivity. We tested global controls on root turnover across climatic gradients and for plant functional groups by using a database of 190 published studies. Root turnover rates increased exponentially with mean annual temperature for fine roots of grasslands (r2 = 0.48) and forests (r2 = 0.17) and for total root biomass in shrublands (r2 = 0.55). On the basis of the best-fit exponential model, the Q10 for root turnover was 1.4 for forest small diameter roots (5 mm or less), 1.6 for grassland fine roots, and 1.9 for shrublands. Surprisingly, after accounting for temperature, there was no such global relationship between precipitation and root turnover. The slowest average turnover rates were observed for entire tree root systems (10\% annually), followed by 34\% for shrubland total roots, 53\% for grassland fine roots, 55\% for wetland fine roots, and 56\% for forest fine roots. Root turnover decreased from tropical to high-latitude systems for all plant functional groups. To test whether global relationships can be used to predict interannual variability in root turnover, we evaluated 14 yr of published root turnover data from a shortgrass steppe site in northeastern Colorado, USA. At this site there was no correlation between interannual variability in mean annual temperature and root turnover. Rather, turnover was positively correlated with the ratio of growing season precipitation and maximum monthly temperature (r2 = 0.61). We conclude that there are global patterns in rates of root turnover between plant groups and across climatic gradients but that these patterns cannot always be used for the successful prediction of the relationship of root turnover to climate change at a particular site.},

@article{Gale1987,
	abstract = { Measurements of root biomass, number, diameter, and length by soil depth for northern tree species were assembled from 19 published papers, yielding a total of 123 vertical root distributions. Species were classified into three tolerance classes based on successional status. A nonlinear function, Y = 1 − βd, where Y is the cumulative root fraction from the soil surface to depth d in centimetres, was fit to the data for each excavation. The regression coefficient, β, was considered to be a measure of vertical root distribution and was used as a response variable to test whether significant differences in vertical root distributions existed among tolerance classes. Early successional or intolerant species had a significantly greater proportion of roots occurring deeper than did late successional or tolerant species. Differences in vertical root distributions are presumed to be related to the inherent genetic potential of early successional species for deep exploitation of a more homogeneous substrate, resulting from either geologic deposition or nutrient and water redistribution following forest disturbance. Early successional species are also able to adapt to sites limiting in water and nutrients because of their ability to exploit larger volumes of soil. Late successional or shallow-rooted species are better adapted to sites where resources are concentrated near the soil surface as the result of biocycling and soil development. },

@article{Ahrens2020,
	abstract = {During the last decade, a paradigmatic shift regarding which processes determine the persistence of soil organic matter (SOM) took place. The interaction between microbial decomposition and association of organic matter with the soil mineral matrix has been identified as a focal point for understanding the formation of stable SOM. Using an improved version of the vertically resolved SOM model COMISSION (Ahrens et al., 2015), this paper investigates the effect of a maximum sorption capacity (Qmax) for mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) formation and its interaction with microbial processes, such as microbial decomposition and microbial necromass production. We define and estimate the maximum sorption capacity Qmax with quantile regressions between mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) and the clay plus silt (<20 μm) content. In the COMISSION v2.0 model, plant- and microbial-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dead microbial cell walls can sorb to mineral surfaces up to Qmax. MAOC can only be decomposed by microorganisms after desorption. We calibrated the COMISSION v2.0 model with data from ten different sites with widely varying textures and Qmax values. COMISSION v2.0 was able to fit the MAOC and SOC depth profiles, as well as the respective 14C gradients with soil depth across these sites. Using the generic set of parameters retrieved in the multi-site calibration, we conducted model experiments to isolate the effects of varying Qmax, point-of-entry of litter inputs, and soil temperature. Across the ten sites, the combination of depolymerization limitation of microorganisms due to substrate scarcity in the subsoil and the size of Qmax explain 14C depth gradients in OC.},

@article{Ahrens2015,
	abstract = {Abstract Profiles of soil organic carbon (SOC) are often characterized by a steep increase of 14C age with depth, often leading to subsoil 14C ages of more than 1000 years. These observations have generally been reproduced in \{SOC\} models by introducing a \{SOC\} pool that decomposes on the time-scale of millennia. The overemphasis of chemical recalcitrance as the major factor for the persistence of \{SOC\} was able to provide a mechanistic justification for these very low decomposition rates. The emerging view on \{SOC\} persistence, however, stresses that apart from molecular structure a multitude of mechanisms can lead to the long-term persistence of organic carbon in soils. These mechanisms, however, have not been incorporated into most models. Consequently, we developed the \{SOC\} profile model \{COMISSION\} which simulates vertically resolved \{SOC\} concentrations based on representations of microbial interactions, sorption to minerals, and vertical transport. We calibrated \{COMISSION\} using published concentrations of SOC, microbial biomass and mineral-associated \{OC\} (MOC), and in addition, 14C contents of \{SOC\} and \{MOC\} of a Haplic Podzol profile in North-Eastern Bavaria, Germany. In order to elucidate the contribution of the implemented processes to the 14C age in different parts of the profile, we performed model-experiments in which we switched off the limitation of \{SOC\} decomposition by microbes, sorptive stabilization on soil minerals, and dissolved \{OC\} (DOC) transport. By splitting all model pools into directly litter-derived carbon and microbe-derived organic carbon, we investigated the contribution of repeated microbial recycling to 14C ages throughout the profile. The model-experiments for this site lead to the following implications: Without rejuvenation by \{DOC\} transport, \{SOC\} in the subsoil would be on average 1700 14C years older. Across the profile, \{SOC\} from microbial recycling is on average 1400 14C years older than litter-derived SOC. Without microbial limitation of depolymerization, \{SOC\} in the subsoil would be on average 610 14C years younger. Sorptive stabilization is responsible for relatively high 14C ages in the topsoil. The model-experiments further indicate that the high \{SOC\} concentrations in the Bh horizon are caused by the interplay between sorptive stabilization and microbial dynamics. Overall, the model-experiments demonstrate that the high 14C ages are not solely caused by slow turnover of a single pool, but that the increase of 14C ages along a soil profile up to ages &gt;1000 years is the result of different mechanisms contributing to the overall persistence of SOC. The dominant reasons for the persistence of \{SOC\} are stabilization processes, followed by repeated microbial processing of SOC. },

@article{Feng1999,
	abstract = {This research examines how vegetation type controls soil processes involving soil carbon fluxes, accumulation, and transport in a chaparral ecosystem. Carbon concentrations and δ13C values were measured for soil samples collected in 1987 from 1-m depth profiles in four lysimeters in the San Dimas Experimental Forest, southern California, USA. Each lysimeter has sustained a single vegetation type since 1946, the species being Quercus dumosa, Ceanothus crassifolius, Adenostoma fasciculatum, and Pinus coulteri. Archived samples of soil originally used for filling the lysimeters and litter samples from the surface of each lysimeter were analyzed to determine initial and boundary conditions. Although detectable changes in carbon content were limited to the topmost 20 cm of the profiles, variations in δ13C were found to depths of 80 cm, indicating that processing of carbon occurs much deeper than indicated by carbon concentrations alone, underscoring the utility of carbon isotopes in the study of soil carbon dynamics. A one-dimensional model that considers surface carbon input, downward transport, and loss through decomposition is developed to describe the evolution of carbon concentration and stable carbon isotope ratios in the four soil profiles. Comparison of measured and calculated profiles yields estimates of carbon fluxes, turnover rates, and accumulation of soil carbon. A set of physical parameters, including the rate constant of decomposition, downward transport rate of organic carbon, and rate of carbon input from the surface are derived from the model and can be related to the species and environmental conditions. The calculations indicate the importance of species on soil formation and carbon cycles, which is important for understanding the effects of changes in land use on ecosystem processes. Our results also suggest that fire may increase the rate of soil carbon accumulation in a chaparral ecosystem.},

@article{Metzler2020JAMES,
	abstract = {Abstract Radiocarbon (14C) is a powerful tracer of the global carbon cycle that is commonly used to assess carbon cycling rates in various Earth system reservoirs and as a benchmark to assess model performance. Therefore, it has been recommended that Earth System Models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 report predicted radiocarbon values for relevant carbon pools. However, a detailed representation of radiocarbon dynamics may be an impractical burden on model developers. Here, we present an alternative approach to compute radiocarbon values from the numerical output of an ESM that does not explicitly represent these dynamics. The approach requires computed 12C stocks and fluxes among all carbon pools for a particular simulation of the model. From this output, a time-dependent linear compartmental system is computed with its respective state-transition matrix. Using transient atmospheric 14C values as inputs, the state-transition matrix is then applied to compute radiocarbon values for each pool, the average value for the entire system, and component fluxes. We demonstrate the approach with ELMv1-ECA, the land component of an ESM model that explicitly represents 12C, and 14C in 7 soil pools and 10 vertical layers. Results from our proposed method are highly accurate (relative error <0.01\%) compared with the ELMv1-ECA 12C and 14C predictions, demonstrating the potential to use this approach in CMIP6 and other model simulations that do not explicitly represent 14C.},

@article{Sierra2018JAMES,
	abstract = {Abstract Models representing exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere include a large variety of processes and mechanisms, and have increased in complexity in the last decades. These models are no exception of the simulation versus understanding conundrum previously articulated for models of the physical climate, which states that increasing detail in process representation in models, and the simulations they produce, hinders understanding of holistic system behavior. However, recent theoretical progress on the mathematical representation of the carbon cycle in ecosystems may help to provide a general framework for the qualitative understanding of models without compromising detail in process representation. Here we (1) briefly review recent ideas on the theory of transient dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle and its matrix representation, pointing out issues of interpretation, (2) show that these ideas can be further generalized in the mathematical concept of nonautonomous compartmental systems, and (3) provide thoughts on how this framework can be used to address a new set of questions in carbon cycle science.},

@article{Sierra2015EM,
	abstract = {We propose here a general mathematical framework to represent soil organic matter dynamics. This framework is expressed in the language of dynamical systems and generalizes previous modeling approaches. It is based on a set of six basic principles about the decomposition of soil organic matter: 1) mass balance, 2) substrate dependence of decomposition, 3) heterogeneity of the speed of decay, 4) internal transformations of organic matter, 5) environmental variability effects, and 6) substrate interactions. We show how the majority of models previously proposed are special cases of this general model. This approach provides tools to classify models according to the main principles or concepts they include. It also helps to identify a priori the general behavior of different models or groups of models. Another important characteristic of the proposed mathematical representation is the possibility to develop particular models at any level of detail. This characteristic is described as a modeling hierarchy, in which a general model of a high degree of abstraction can accommodate specific realizations of model structure for specific modeling objectives. This framework also allows us to study general properties of groups of models such as their qualitative behavior, time-scale of application, and their dynamic stability. For instance, we find conditions under which models are asymptotically stable, i.e. converge to a stable steady-state in the long-term, but may approach this state with or without oscillations. We also expand the concept of dynamic stability for models that include time-dependencies and do not converge to a fixed steady-state, but rather to a region of stability in the state-space. As an example of the application of the concept of dynamic stability, we show how this framework helps to explain the acclimation of soil respiration fluxes in soil warming experiments.},
