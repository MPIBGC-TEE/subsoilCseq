Stocks of carbon in the subsoil are large and old, highly relevant for carbon sequestration in natural systems in the context of climate change mitigation. 
We reviewed mathematical models that represent soil carbon dynamics with depth and found that 
most models adopt the diffusion, advection, reaction (decomposition) paradigm. 
Transport processes play a secondary role in shaping soil carbon profiles, with the difference between carbon inputs and decomposition (g) playing a major role. 
Carbon stocks in the subsoil can be increased by decreasing the rate of change of soil carbon with depth, increasing vertical transport (v) or decreasing g.
